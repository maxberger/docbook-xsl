  <para>
    The DocBook community has developed several variants that, while
    not part of the normative specification, have proven to be
    useful. These include:

          <para>
            Simplified DocBook is a proper subset of
            DocBook. Therefore, any valid instance will also be valid
            against the full DocBook schema. The objective is to
            provide a significantly smaller schema that is useful for
            articles and other small documents. As of the publication
            of this book, the latest version of Simplified DocBook was
            based on DocBook <acronym>V4.5</acronym>. Further
            information can be found at <link
            xlink:href="http://www.docbook.org/schemas/simplified"/>.

          <para>
            The DocBook website schema is a customization of the
            schema designed for building websites. There is also
            support in the DocBook stylesheets for this schema. As of
            the publication of this book, there is a version of the
            schema based on DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> under
            development. Information about the DocBook website and how
            to use it can be found in <citetitle>DocBook XSL: The
            Complete Guide</citetitle><biblioref linkend="Stayton07"/>
            and at
            <link xlink:href="http://www.dpawson.co.uk/docbook/website/"/>.
            The latter has information about the DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym>
            version of the schema.

    <para>
      With the introduction of DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym>, there
      have been several new initiatives started to take advantage of
      the increased flexibility and customizability of the standard.
      Two of these initiatives have become subcommittees of the
      <acronym>OASIS</acronym> DocBook Technical Committee:

          <para>
            This subcommittee is chartered to develop and maintain
            official variants of DocBook in support of the publishing
            industry. In May, 2009, this subcommittee released <link
            xlink:href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/docbook/specs/publishers-1.0-spec-cd-01.html">The
            DocBook Publishers Schema Version 1.0</link>, a draft

            This subcommittee will develop enhancements to the DocBook

            educational activities.

      <title>DocBook Assembly Mechanism</title>

      <indexterm><primary>future directions</primary><secondary>assembly mechanism</secondary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>topic-oriented writing</primary></indexterm>
      <para>
        In addition to these two subcommittees, there is a current
        effort to create markup for an <quote>assembly</quote>
        capability to better support development of documents using a
        modular approach.
      </para>
      <para>
         Most modular methodologies use a topic-oriented approach,
         where writers create independent units of information that
         are meant to stand alone.  Topics are then collected into a
         library in much the same way that programmers create
         libraries of functions.  Authors select the topics they
         need to assemble the documentation for a particular system
         from the library.
      </para>
      <para>
        In order to support modular methodologies, you need support
        for marking up individual topics, which DocBook does well. You
        also need support for some kind of <quote>map</quote> or
        <quote>assembly</quote> file that identifies which topics are required
        for a particular deliverable, and at least for print deliverables,
        what order they should be presented in.
      </para>
      <para>
        The proposed DocBook assembly would serve this purpose. While
        still under consideration as this book is being written, the
        general outline of an assembly is clear. It would identify a
        collection of resources (which could include topics and other
        modules), an ordering of those resources for a particular
        document, a set of relationships between resources, and the
        transformations that are to be applied to the collection.
      </para>
      <para>
        While DocBook already supports many aspects of topic-oriented
        writing, the assembly mechanism is being designed to provide a more
        capable and intuitive model for this type of methodology.
