  <para>These are the release notes for the DocBook XSL2 Stylesheets.
  At a minimum, this file attempts to document changes to the public
  APIs, particularly to user-configurable parameters. This file also
  provides a high-level overview of the features added in each
  release.</para>

  <para>Bug fixes are (mostly) not documented here. For a complete
  list of changes, including descriptions of bug fixes, see the <ulink
  url="NEWS"/> file, which is auto-generated from the checkin
  descriptions for changes in the project CVS repository.</para>
