common use requirement for technical publications groups is to produce a Web-based help format that includes a table of contents pane, a search feature, 

and an index similar to what you get from the Microsoft HTML Help (.chm) format or Eclipse help. If the content is help for a Web application that is not

exposed to the Internet or requires that the user be logged in, then it is impossible to use services like Google to add search.

You must use xhtml output because the search indexer cannot index html.

No support for stemming. If you search for "start" it will not find "started" and vice versa.
