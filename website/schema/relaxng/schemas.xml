  This is a schema-locating file for use with a RELAX NG-aware
  editor such as Emacs/nXML mode. It tells your editor to
  automatically associate any documents whose root element is
  "webpage" (that is DocBook Websited documents), with the RNC
  schema file at the URI "website.rnc".

  To use this file with Emacs/nXML mode, put the following into
  your .emacs file:

    (setq rng-schema-locating-files
      (append
        '("/usr/share/xml/docbook/website/schema/relaxng/schemas.xml")))

   Of course, replace the pathname with the appropriate location
   for your system.
