<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BASTARD</speaker>
<line>Most certain of one mother, mighty king;</line>
<line>That is well known; and, as I think, one father:</line>
<line>But for the certain knowledge of that truth</line>
<line>I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:</line>

<speaker role="speaker">BASTARD</speaker>
<line>I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;</line>
<line>That is my brother's plea and none of mine;</line>
<line>The which if he can prove, a' pops me out</line>
<line>At least from fair five hundred pound a year:</line>
<line>Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BASTARD</speaker>
<line>I know not why, except to get the land.</line>
<line>But once he slander'd me with bastardy:</line>
<line>But whether I be as true begot or no,</line>
<line>That still I lay upon my mother's head,</line>
<line>But that I am as well begot, my liege,--</line>
<line>Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--</line>
<line>Compare our faces and be judge yourself.</line>
<line>If old sir Robert did beget us both</line>
<line>And were our father and this son like him,</line>
<line>O old sir Robert, father, on my knee</line>
<line>I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<line>He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;</line>
<line>The accent of his tongue affecteth him.</line>
<line>Do you not read some tokens of my son</line>
<line>In the large composition of this man?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING JOHN</speaker>
<line>Mine eye hath well examined his parts</line>
<line>And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,</line>
<line>What doth move you to claim your brother's land?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BASTARD</speaker>
<line>Because he hath a half-face, like my father.</line>
<line>With half that face would he have all my land:</line>
<line>A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ROBERT</speaker>
<line>My gracious liege, when that my father lived,</line>
<line>Your brother did employ my father much,--</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BASTARD</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:</line>
<line>Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ROBERT</speaker>
<line>And once dispatch'd him in an embassy</line>
<line>To Germany, there with the emperor</line>
<line>To treat of high affairs touching that time.</line>
<line>The advantage of his absence took the king</line>
<line>And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;</line>
<line>Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,</line>
<line>But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores</line>
<line>Between my father and my mother lay,</line>
<line>As I have heard my father speak himself,</line>
<line>When this same lusty gentleman was got.</line>
<line>Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd</line>
<line>His lands to me, and took it on his death</line>
<line>That this my mother's son was none of his;</line>
<line>And if he were, he came into the world</line>
<line>Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.</line>
<line>Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,</line>
<line>My father's land, as was my father's will.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING JOHN</speaker>
<line>Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;</line>
<line>Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,</line>
<line>And if she did play false, the fault was hers;</line>
<line>Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands</line>
<line>That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,</line>
<line>Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,</line>
<line>Had of your father claim'd this son for his?</line>
<line>In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept</line>
<line>This calf bred from his cow from all the world;</line>
<line>In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,</line>
<line>My brother might not claim him; nor your father,</line>
<line>Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;</line>
<line>My mother's son did get your father's heir;</line>
<line>Your father's heir must have your father's land.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ROBERT</speaker>

<line>That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose</line>
<line>Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'</line>
<line>And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,</line>
<line>Would I might never stir from off this place,</line>

<line>This royal hand and mine are newly knit,</line>
<line>And the conjunction of our inward souls</line>
<line>Married in league, coupled and linked together</line>
<line>With all religious strength of sacred vows;</line>
<line>The latest breath that gave the sound of words</line>
<line>Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love</line>
<line>Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,</line>
<line>And even before this truce, but new before,</line>
<line>No longer than we well could wash our hands</line>
<line>To clap this royal bargain up of peace,</line>
<line>Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd</line>
<line>With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint</line>
<line>The fearful difference of incensed kings:</line>
<line>And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,</line>
<line>So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,</line>
<line>Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?</line>
<line>Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,</line>
<line>Make such unconstant children of ourselves,</line>
<line>As now again to snatch our palm from palm,</line>
<line>Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed</line>
<line>Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,</line>
<line>And make a riot on the gentle brow</line>
<line>Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,</line>
<line>My reverend father, let it not be so!</line>

<line>A mother's curse, on her revolting son.</line>
<line>France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,</line>
<line>A chafed lion by the mortal paw,</line>

<line>So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;</line>

<line>Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow</line>
<line>First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,</line>
<line>That is, to be the champion of our church!</line>
<line>What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself</line>
<line>And may not be performed by thyself,</line>
<line>For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss</line>
<line>Is not amiss when it is truly done,</line>
<line>And being not done, where doing tends to ill,</line>
<line>The truth is then most done not doing it:</line>
<line>The better act of purposes mistook</line>
<line>Is to mistake again; though indirect,</line>
<line>Yet indirection thereby grows direct,</line>
<line>And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire</line>
<line>Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.</line>
<line>It is religion that doth make vows kept;</line>
<line>But thou hast sworn against religion,</line>
<line>By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,</line>
<line>And makest an oath the surety for thy truth</line>
<line>Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure</line>
<line>To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;</line>
<line>Else what a mockery should it be to swear!</line>
<line>But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;</line>
<line>And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.</line>
<line>Therefore thy later vows against thy first</line>
<line>Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;</line>
<line>And better conquest never canst thou make</line>
<line>Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts</line>
<line>Against these giddy loose suggestions:</line>
<line>Upon which better part our prayers come in,</line>
<line>If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know</line>
<line>The peril of our curses light on thee</line>

<line>Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind</line>
<line>To do the office for thee of revenge,</line>
<line>And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,</line>
<line>As it on earth hath been thy servant still.</line>
<line>Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,</line>
<line>Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,</line>
<line>And instantly return with me again,</line>
<line>To push destruction and perpetual shame</line>
<line>Out of the weak door of our fainting land.</line>
<line>Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;</line>
<line>The Dauphin rages at our very heels.</line>

<line>It seems you know not, then, so much as we:</line>
<line>The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,</line>
<line>Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,</line>
<line>And brings from him such offers of our peace</line>
<line>As we with honour and respect may take,</line>
<line>With purpose presently to leave this war.</line>

<line>He will the rather do it when he sees</line>
<line>Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">SALISBURY</speaker>
<line>Nay, it is in a manner done already;</line>
<line>For many carriages he hath dispatch'd</line>
<line>To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel</line>
<line>To the disposing of the cardinal:</line>
<line>With whom yourself, myself and other lords,</line>
<line>If you think meet, this afternoon will post</line>
<line>To consummate this business happily.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BASTARD</speaker>
<line>Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,</line>
<line>With other princes that may best be spared,</line>
<line>Shall wait upon your father's funeral.</line>

<line>At Worcester must his body be interr'd;</line>

<speaker role="speaker">BASTARD</speaker>
<line>Thither shall it then:</line>
<line>And happily may your sweet self put on</line>
<line>The lineal state and glory of the land!</line>
<line>To whom with all submission, on my knee</line>
<line>I do bequeath my faithful services</line>
<line>And true subjection everlastingly.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SALISBURY</speaker>
<line>And the like tender of our love we make,</line>
<line>To rest without a spot for evermore.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>I have a kind soul that would give you thanks</line>
<line>And knows not how to do it but with tears.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">BASTARD</speaker>
<line>O, let us pay the time but needful woe,</line>
<line>Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.</line>
<line>This England never did, nor never shall,</line>
<line>Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,</line>
<line>But when it first did help to wound itself.</line>
<line>Now these her princes are come home again,</line>
<line>Come the three corners of the world in arms,</line>
<line>And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,</line>
<line>If England to itself do rest but true.</line>
