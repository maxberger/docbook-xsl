<line>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;</line>
<line>I am not partial to infringe our laws:</line>
<line>The enmity and discord which of late</line>
<line>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</line>
<line>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</line>
<line>Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives</line>
<line>Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</line>
<line>Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.</line>
<line>For, since the mortal and intestine jars</line>
<line>'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</line>
<line>It hath in solemn synods been decreed</line>
<line>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</line>
<line>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,</line>
<line>If any born at Ephesus be seen</line>
<line>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</line>
<line>Again: if any Syracusian born</line>
<line>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</line>
<line>His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,</line>
<line>Unless a thousand marks be levied,</line>
<line>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</line>
<line>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</line>
<line>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</line>
<line>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</line>
<line>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</speaker>
<line>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</line>
<line>Why thou departed'st from thy native home</line>
<line>And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">AEGEON</speaker>
<line>A heavier task could not have been imposed</line>
<line>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</line>
<line>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</line>
<line>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</line>
<line>I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</line>
<line>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</line>
<line>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</line>
<line>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</line>
<line>With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</line>
<line>By prosperous voyages I often made</line>
<line>To Epidamnum; till my factor's death</line>
<line>And the great care of goods at random left</line>
<line>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</line>
<line>From whom my absence was not six months old</line>
<line>Before herself, almost at fainting under</line>
<line>The pleasing punishment that women bear,</line>
<line>Had made provision for her following me</line>
<line>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</line>
<line>There had she not been long, but she became</line>
<line>A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</line>
<line>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</line>
<line>As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</line>
<line>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</line>
<line>A meaner woman was delivered</line>
<line>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</line>
<line>Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--</line>
<line>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</line>
<line>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</line>
<line>Made daily motions for our home return:</line>
<line>Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</line>
<line>We came aboard.</line>
<line>A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</line>
<line>Before the always wind-obeying deep</line>
<line>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</line>
<line>But longer did we not retain much hope;</line>
<line>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</line>
<line>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</line>
<line>A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</line>
<line>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</line>
<line>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</line>
<line>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</line>
<line>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</line>
<line>That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</line>
<line>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</line>
<line>And this it was, for other means was none:</line>
<line>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</line>
<line>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</line>
<line>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</line>
<line>Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</line>
<line>Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</line>
<line>To him one of the other twins was bound,</line>
<line>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</line>
<line>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</line>
<line>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</line>
<line>Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</line>
<line>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</line>
<line>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</line>
<line>Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</line>
<line>And by the benefit of his wished light,</line>
<line>The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</line>
<line>Two ships from far making amain to us,</line>
<line>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</line>
<line>But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!</line>
<line>Gather the sequel by that went before.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</speaker>
<line>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;</line>
<line>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">AEGEON</speaker>
<line>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</line>
<line>Worthily term'd them merciless to us!</line>
<line>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</line>
<line>We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</line>
<line>Which being violently borne upon,</line>
<line>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</line>
<line>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</line>
<line>Fortune had left to both of us alike</line>
<line>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</line>
<line>Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</line>
<line>With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</line>
<line>Was carried with more speed before the wind;</line>
<line>And in our sight they three were taken up</line>
<line>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line>At length, another ship had seized on us;</line>
<line>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</line>
<line>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;</line>
<line>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</line>
<line>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</line>
<line>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</line>
<line>Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;</line>
<line>That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,</line>
<line>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</speaker>
<line>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</line>
<line>Do me the favour to dilate at full</line>
<line>What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">AEGEON</speaker>
<line>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</line>
<line>At eighteen years became inquisitive</line>
<line>After his brother: and importuned me</line>
<line>That his attendant--so his case was like,</line>
<line>Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--</line>
<line>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</line>
<line>Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,</line>
<line>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.</line>
<line>Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,</line>
<line>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</line>
<line>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</line>
<line>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</line>
<line>Or that or any place that harbours men.</line>
<line>But here must end the story of my life;</line>
<line>And happy were I in my timely death,</line>
<line>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</line>

<line>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</line>
<line>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</line>
<line>My soul would sue as advocate for thee.</line>
<line>But, though thou art adjudged to the death</line>
<line>And passed sentence may not be recall'd</line>
<line>But to our honour's great disparagement,</line>
<line>Yet I will favour thee in what I can.</line>
<line>Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day</line>
<line>To seek thy life by beneficial help:</line>
<line>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</line>
<line>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</line>

<line>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</line>

<line>Name them.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</speaker>
<line>The one, to save the money that he spends in</line>

<line>drop in his porridge.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</speaker>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</speaker>
<line>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no</line>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>My liege, I am advised what I say,</line>
<line>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</line>
<line>Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,</line>
<line>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</line>
<line>This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:</line>
<line>That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,</line>
<line>Could witness it, for he was with me then;</line>
<line>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</line>
<line>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</line>
<line>Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</line>
<line>Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</line>
<line>I went to seek him: in the street I met him</line>
<line>And in his company that gentleman.</line>
<line>There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down</line>
<line>That I this day of him received the chain,</line>
<line>Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which</line>
<line>He did arrest me with an officer.</line>
<line>I did obey, and sent my peasant home</line>
<line>For certain ducats: he with none return'd</line>
<line>Then fairly I bespoke the officer</line>
<line>To go in person with me to my house.</line>
<line>By the way we met</line>
<line>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</line>
<line>Of vile confederates. Along with them</line>
<line>They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,</line>
<line>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</line>
<line>A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,</line>
<line>A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,</line>
<line>A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,</line>
<line>Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</line>
<line>And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</line>
<line>And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,</line>
<line>Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together</line>
<line>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence</line>
<line>And in a dark and dankish vault at home</line>
<line>There left me and my man, both bound together;</line>
<line>Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</line>
<line>I gain'd my freedom, and immediately</line>
<line>Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech</line>
<line>To give me ample satisfaction</line>
<line>For these deep shames and great indignities.</line>

<line>Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine</line>
