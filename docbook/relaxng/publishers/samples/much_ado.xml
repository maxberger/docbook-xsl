<para role="stagedir">Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a
Messenger</para>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon</line>
<line>comes this night to Messina.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off</line>
<line>when I left him.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>But few of any sort, and none of name.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings</line>
<line>home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath</line>
<line>bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by</line>
<line>Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the</line>
<line>promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,</line>
<line>the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</line>
<line>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</line>
<line>tell you how.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much</line>
<line>glad of it.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>I have already delivered him letters, and there</line>
<line>appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could</line>
<line>not show itself modest enough without a badge of</line>
<line>bitterness.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>Did he break out into tears?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>In great measure.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces</line>
<line>truer than those that are so washed. How much</line>
<line>better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the</line>
<line>wars or no?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>I know none of that name, lady: there was none such</line>
<line>in the army of any sort.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>What is he that you ask for, niece?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HERO</speaker>
<line>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged</line>
<line>Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading</line>
<line>the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged</line>
<line>him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he</line>
<line>killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath</line>
<line>he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;</line>
<line>but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:</line>
<line>he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an</line>
<line>excellent stomach.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>And a good soldier too, lady.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all</line>
<line>honourable virtues.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:</line>
<line>but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a</line>
<line>kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:</line>
<line>they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit</line>
<line>between them.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last</line>
<line>conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and</line>
<line>now is the whole man governed with one: so that if</line>
<line>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</line>
<line>bear it for a difference between himself and his</line>
<line>horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,</line>
<line>to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his</line>
<line>companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>Is't possible?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as</line>
<line>the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the</line>
<line>next block.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray</line>
<line>you, who is his companion? Is there no young</line>
<line>squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he</line>
<line>is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker</line>
<line>runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if</line>
<line>he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a</line>
<line>thousand pound ere a' be cured.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>I will hold friends with you, lady.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>Do, good friend.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>You will never run mad, niece.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>No, not till a hot January.</line>

and BALTHASAR</para>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DON PEDRO</speaker>
<line>Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your</line>
<line>trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid</line>
<line>cost, and you encounter it.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of</line>
<line>your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should</line>
<line>remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides</line>
<line>and happiness takes his leave.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DON PEDRO</speaker>
<line>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this</line>
<line>is your daughter.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>Her mother hath many times told me so.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BENEDICK</speaker>
<line>Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DON PEDRO</speaker>
<line>You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this</line>
<line>what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers</line>
<line>herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an</line>
<line>honourable father.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BENEDICK</speaker>
<line>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior</line>

<line>What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath</line>
<line>such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?</line>
<line>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come</line>
<line>in her presence.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BENEDICK</speaker>
<line>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I</line>
<line>am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I</line>
<line>would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard</line>
<line>heart; for, truly, I love none.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEATRICE</speaker>
<line>A dear happiness to women: they would else have</line>
<line>been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God</line>
<line>and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I</line>
<line>had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man</line>
<line>swear he loves me.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BENEDICK</speaker>
<line>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some</line>

<line>No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</line>

<line>Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high</line>

<line>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</line>
<line>Misprising what they look on, and her wit</line>

<line>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</line>

<line>She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</line>
<line>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,</line>
<line>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</line>
<line>If low, an agate very vilely cut;</line>
<line>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</line>

<line>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions</line>

<line>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</line>
<line>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</line>
<line>Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,</line>

<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</line>

<line>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</line>
<line>Nor age so eat up my invention,</line>
<line>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,</line>
<line>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,</line>
<line>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,</line>
<line>Both strength of limb and policy of mind,</line>
<line>Ability in means and choice of friends,</line>
<line>To quit me of them throughly.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<line>Pause awhile,</line>
<line>And let my counsel sway you in this case.</line>
<line>Your daughter here the princes left for dead:</line>
<line>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</line>
<line>And publish it that she is dead indeed;</line>
<line>Maintain a mourning ostentation</line>
<line>And on your family's old monument</line>
<line>Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites</line>
<line>That appertain unto a burial.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONATO</speaker>
<line>What shall become of this? what will this do?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<line>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf</line>
<line>Change slander to remorse; that is some good:</line>
<line>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</line>
<line>But on this travail look for greater birth.</line>
<line>She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,</line>
<line>Upon the instant that she was accused,</line>
<line>Shall be lamented, pitied and excused</line>
<line>Of every hearer: for it so falls out</line>
<line>That what we have we prize not to the worth</line>
<line>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,</line>
<line>Why, then we rack the value, then we find</line>
<line>The virtue that possession would not show us</line>
<line>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</line>
<line>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</line>
<line>The idea of her life shall sweetly creep</line>
<line>Into his study of imagination,</line>
<line>And every lovely organ of her life</line>
<line>Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,</line>
<line>More moving-delicate and full of life,</line>
<line>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</line>
<line>Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,</line>
<line>If ever love had interest in his liver,</line>
<line>And wish he had not so accused her,</line>
<line>No, though he thought his accusation true.</line>
<line>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</line>
<line>Will fashion the event in better shape</line>
<line>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</line>
<line>But if all aim but this be levell'd false,</line>
<line>The supposition of the lady's death</line>
<line>Will quench the wonder of her infamy:</line>
<line>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</line>
<line>As best befits her wounded reputation,</line>
<line>In some reclusive and religious life,</line>
<line>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.</line>
