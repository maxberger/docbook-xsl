<line>Admirable: how this grace</line>

<line>One might interpret.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,</line>
<line>Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</line>
<line>With amplest entertainment: my free drift</line>
<line>Halts not particularly, but moves itself</line>
<line>In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice</line>
<line>Infects one comma in the course I hold;</line>
<line>But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,</line>

<line>You see how all conditions, how all minds,</line>

<line>Of grave and austere quality, tender down</line>
<line>Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune</line>
<line>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging</line>
<line>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</line>
<line>All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer</line>
<line>To Apemantus, that few things loves better</line>
<line>Than to abhor himself: even he drops down</line>
<line>The knee before him, and returns in peace</line>
<line>Most rich in Timon's nod.</line>

<line>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</line>
<line>Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount</line>
<line>Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,</line>
<line>That labour on the bosom of this sphere</line>
<line>To propagate their states: amongst them all,</line>
<line>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,</line>
<line>One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,</line>
<line>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;</line>
<line>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</line>
<line>Translates his rivals.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Painter</speaker>
<line>'Tis conceived to scope.</line>
<line>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</line>
<line>With one man beckon'd from the rest below,</line>
<line>Bowing his head against the sleepy mount</line>
<line>To climb his happiness, would be well express'd</line>
<line>In our condition.</line>

<line>Nay, sir, but hear me on.</line>

<line>Some better than his value, on the moment</line>
<line>Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</line>
<line>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</line>
<line>Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</line>
<line>Drink the free air.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Painter</speaker>
<line>'Tis common:</line>
<line>A thousand moral paintings I can show</line>
