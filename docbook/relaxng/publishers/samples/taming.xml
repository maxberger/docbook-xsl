<speaker role="speaker">GRUMIO</speaker>
<line>Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.</line>
<line>if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his</line>
<line>service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap</line>
<line>him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to</line>
<line>use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,</line>
<line>two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had</line>

<line>And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale</line>
<line>Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PETRUCHIO</speaker>
<line>Such wind as scatters young men through the world,</line>
<line>To seek their fortunes farther than at home</line>
<line>Where small experience grows. But in a few,</line>
<line>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</line>
<line>Antonio, my father, is deceased;</line>
<line>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</line>
<line>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:</line>
<line>Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,</line>
<line>And so am come abroad to see the world.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HORTENSIO</speaker>
<line>Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee</line>
<line>And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?</line>
<line>Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:</line>
<line>And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich</line>
<line>And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,</line>
<line>And I'll not wish thee to her.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PETRUCHIO</speaker>
<line>Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we</line>
<line>Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know</line>
<line>One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,</line>
<line>As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,</line>
<line>Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,</line>
<line>As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd</line>
<line>As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,</line>
<line>She moves me not, or not removes, at least,</line>
<line>Affection's edge in me, were she as rough</line>
<line>As are the swelling Adriatic seas:</line>
<line>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;</line>
<line>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GRUMIO</speaker>
<line>Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his</line>
<line>mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to</line>
<line>a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er</line>
<line>a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases</line>
<line>as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,</line>
<line>so money comes withal.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HORTENSIO</speaker>
<line>Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,</line>
<line>I will continue that I broach'd in jest.</line>
<line>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</line>
<line>With wealth enough and young and beauteous,</line>
<line>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:</line>
<line>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</line>
<line>Is that she is intolerable curst</line>
<line>And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure</line>
<line>That, were my state far worser than it is,</line>
<line>I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PETRUCHIO</speaker>
<line>Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:</line>
<line>Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;</line>
<line>For I will board her, though she chide as loud</line>
<line>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HORTENSIO</speaker>
<line>Her father is Baptista Minola,</line>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PETRUCHIO</speaker>
<line>I know her father, though I know not her;</line>

<line>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;</line>

<line>To give you over at this first encounter,</line>
<line>Unless you will accompany me thither.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GRUMIO</speaker>
<line>I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.</line>
<line>O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she</line>
<line>would think scolding would do little good upon him:</line>
<line>she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:</line>
<line>why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in</line>
<line>his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she</line>
<line>stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in</line>
<line>her face and so disfigure her with it that she</line>

<line>His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,</line>
<line>And her withholds from me and other more,</line>

<line>Supposing it a thing impossible,</line>
<line>For those defects I have before rehearsed,</line>
<line>That ever Katharina will be woo'd;</line>
<line>Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,</line>
