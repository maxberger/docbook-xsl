<line>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</line>
<line>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</line>
<line>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</line>
<line>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,</line>
<line>I am to learn;</line>
<line>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</line>
<line>That I have much ado to know myself.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SALARINO</speaker>
<line>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</line>
<line>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</line>
<line>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</line>
<line>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</line>
<line>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</line>
<line>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</line>
<line>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SALANIO</speaker>
<line>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</line>
<line>The better part of my affections would</line>
<line>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</line>
<line>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</line>
<line>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</line>
<line>And every object that might make me fear</line>
<line>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</line>
<line>Would make me sad.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SALARINO</speaker>
<line>My wind cooling my broth</line>
<line>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</line>
<line>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</line>
<line>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</line>
<line>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</line>
<line>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,</line>
<line>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</line>
<line>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</line>
<line>And see the holy edifice of stone,</line>
<line>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</line>
<line>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,</line>
<line>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</line>
<line>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</line>
<line>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</line>
<line>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</line>
<line>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</line>
<line>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</line>
<line>But tell not me; I know, Antonio</line>
<line>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</line>
<line>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</line>

<line>Upon the fortune of this present year:</line>
<line>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</line>

<line>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</line>
<line>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</line>
<line>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</line>
<line>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</line>
<line>And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,</line>
<line>And other of such vinegar aspect</line>
<line>That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,</line>

<line>Let me play the fool:</line>
<line>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</line>

<line>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</line>
<line>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</line>
<line>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice</line>
<line>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--</line>
<line>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--</line>
<line>There are a sort of men whose visages</line>
<line>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</line>
<line>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</line>
<line>With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion</line>
<line>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</line>
<line>As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,</line>
<line>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'</line>
<line>O my Antonio, I do know of these</line>
<line>That therefore only are reputed wise</line>
<line>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</line>
<line>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</line>
<line>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</line>
<line>I'll tell thee more of this another time:</line>
<line>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,</line>

<line>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more</line>

<speaker role="speaker">BASSANIO</speaker>
<line>'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</line>
<line>How much I have disabled mine estate,</line>
<line>By something showing a more swelling port</line>
<line>Than my faint means would grant continuance:</line>
<line>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged</line>
<line>From such a noble rate; but my chief care</line>
<line>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</line>
<line>Wherein my time something too prodigal</line>
<line>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</line>
<line>I owe the most, in money and in love,</line>
<line>And from your love I have a warranty</line>
<line>To unburden all my plots and purposes</line>
<line>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</line>

<line>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</line>
<line>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</line>
<line>The self-same way with more advised watch,</line>
<line>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</line>
<line>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,</line>
<line>Because what follows is pure innocence.</line>
<line>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</line>
<line>That which I owe is lost; but if you please</line>
<line>To shoot another arrow that self way</line>
<line>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</line>
<line>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</line>
<line>Or bring your latter hazard back again</line>
<line>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>You know me well, and herein spend but time</line>
<line>To wind about my love with circumstance;</line>
<line>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</line>
<line>In making question of my uttermost</line>
<line>Than if you had made waste of all I have:</line>
<line>Then do but say to me what I should do</line>
<line>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</line>

<line>In Belmont is a lady richly left;</line>
<line>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</line>
<line>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes</line>
<line>I did receive fair speechless messages:</line>
<line>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued</line>
<line>To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:</line>
<line>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</line>
<line>For the four winds blow in from every coast</line>
<line>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</line>
<line>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;</line>
<line>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,</line>
<line>And many Jasons come in quest of her.</line>
<line>O my Antonio, had I but the means</line>
<line>To hold a rival place with one of them,</line>
<line>I have a mind presages me such thrift,</line>
<line>That I should questionless be fortunate!</line>

<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;</line>

<line>Try what my credit can in Venice do:</line>
<line>That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,</line>
<line>To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</line>
<line>Go, presently inquire, and so will I,</line>

<line>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in</line>

<line>yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit</line>
<line>with too much as they that starve with nothing. It</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to</line>
<line>do, chapels had been churches and poor men's</line>
<line>cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that</line>
<line>follows his own instructions: I can easier teach</line>
<line>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the</line>
<line>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may</line>
<line>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</line>
<line>o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</line>
<line>youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the</line>
<line>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</line>
<line>choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may</line>
<line>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</line>
<line>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed</line>
<line>by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</line>
<line>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NERISSA</speaker>
<line>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their</line>
<line>death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,</line>
<line>that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,</line>
<line>silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</line>
<line>chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any</line>
<line>rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what</line>
<line>warmth is there in your affection towards any of</line>
<line>these princely suitors that are already come?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest</line>
<line>them, I will describe them; and, according to my</line>
<line>description, level at my affection.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NERISSA</speaker>
<line>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but</line>
<line>talk of his horse; and he makes it a great</line>
<line>appropriation to his own good parts, that he can</line>
<line>shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his</line>
<line>mother played false with a smith.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NERISSA</speaker>
<line>Then there is the County Palatine.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you</line>
<line>will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and</line>
<line>smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping</line>
<line>philosopher when he grows old, being so full of</line>
<line>unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be</line>
<line>married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth</line>
<line>than to either of these. God defend me from these</line>
<line>two!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NERISSA</speaker>
<line>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.</line>
<line>In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,</line>
<line>he! why, he hath a horse better than the</line>
<line>Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than</line>
<line>the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a</line>
<line>throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will</line>
<line>fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I</line>
<line>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me</line>
<line>I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I</line>
<line>shall never requite him.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NERISSA</speaker>
<line>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron</line>
<line>of England?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands</line>
<line>not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,</line>
<line>nor Italian, and you will come into the court and</line>
<line>swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.</line>
<line>He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can</line>
<line>converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!</line>
<line>I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round</line>
<line>hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his</line>
<line>behavior every where.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NERISSA</speaker>
<line>What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he</line>
<line>borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and</line>
<line>swore he would pay him again when he was able: I</line>
<line>think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed</line>
<line>under for another.</line>

<line>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and</line>
<line>most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when</line>
<line>he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and</line>
<line>when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:</line>
<line>and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall</line>
<line>make shift to go without him.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NERISSA</speaker>
<line>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right</line>

<line>will, if you should refuse to accept him.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a</line>
<line>deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,</line>
<line>for if the devil be within and that temptation</line>
<line>without, I know he will choose it. I will do any</line>

<speaker role="speaker">NERISSA</speaker>
<line>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these</line>

<line>With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;</line>
<line>'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;</line>

<line>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,</line>
<line>In graces and in qualities of breeding;</line>
<line>But more than these, in love I do deserve.</line>
<line>What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?</line>

<line>O sweet Portia,</line>
<line>Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words</line>
<line>That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</line>
<line>When I did first impart my love to you,</line>
<line>I freely told you, all the wealth I had</line>
<line>Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;</line>
<line>And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,</line>
<line>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</line>
<line>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</line>
<line>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</line>
<line>That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,</line>
<line>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</line>
<line>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,</line>
<line>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;</line>
<line>The paper as the body of my friend,</line>
<line>And every word in it a gaping wound,</line>
<line>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</line>
<line>Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?</line>
<line>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</line>
<line>From Lisbon, Barbary and India?</line>
<line>And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch</line>

<line>Besides, it should appear, that if he had</line>
<line>The present money to discharge the Jew,</line>
<line>He would not take it. Never did I know</line>
<line>A creature, that did bear the shape of man,</line>
<line>So keen and greedy to confound a man:</line>
<line>He plies the duke at morning and at night,</line>
<line>And doth impeach the freedom of the state,</line>
<line>If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,</line>
<line>The duke himself, and the magnificoes</line>
<line>Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;</line>

<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>The quality of mercy is not strain'd,</line>
<line>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</line>

<line>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:</line>
<line>'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes</line>
<line>The throned monarch better than his crown;</line>
<line>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</line>
<line>The attribute to awe and majesty,</line>
<line>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</line>
<line>But mercy is above this sceptred sway;</line>
<line>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</line>
<line>It is an attribute to God himself;</line>
<line>And earthly power doth then show likest God's</line>
<line>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</line>
<line>Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</line>
<line>That, in the course of justice, none of us</line>
<line>Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;</line>
<line>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</line>
<line>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</line>
<line>To mitigate the justice of thy plea;</line>
<line>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</line>
<line>Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.</line>

<line>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</line>

<line>If you had known the virtue of the ring,</line>
<line>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</line>
<line>Or your own honour to contain the ring,</line>
<line>You would not then have parted with the ring.</line>
<line>What man is there so much unreasonable,</line>
<line>If you had pleased to have defended it</line>
<line>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</line>
<line>To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</line>
<line>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:</line>
<line>I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BASSANIO</speaker>
<line>No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,</line>
<line>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</line>
<line>Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me</line>
<line>And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him</line>
<line>And suffer'd him to go displeased away;</line>
<line>Even he that did uphold the very life</line>
<line>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</line>
<line>I was enforced to send it after him;</line>
<line>I was beset with shame and courtesy;</line>
<line>My honour would not let ingratitude</line>
<line>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;</line>
<line>For, by these blessed candles of the night,</line>
<line>Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd</line>
<line>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PORTIA</speaker>
<line>Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:</line>
<line>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</line>

<line>I will become as liberal as you;</line>
<line>I'll not deny him any thing I have,</line>
<line>No, not my body nor my husband's bed:</line>
<line>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:</line>
<line>Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:</line>
<line>If you do not, if I be left alone,</line>
<line>Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,</line>
