<speaker role="speaker">GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<line>Now is the winter of our discontent</line>
<line>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</line>
<line>And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house</line>
<line>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</line>
<line>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</line>
<line>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</line>
<line>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</line>
<line>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</line>
<line>Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</line>
<line>And now, instead of mounting barded steeds</line>
<line>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</line>
<line>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</line>
<line>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</line>
<line>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</line>
<line>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</line>
<line>I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty</line>
<line>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</line>
<line>I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</line>
<line>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</line>
<line>Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time</line>
<line>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</line>
<line>And that so lamely and unfashionable</line>
<line>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</line>
<line>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</line>
<line>Have no delight to pass away the time,</line>
<line>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</line>
<line>And descant on mine own deformity:</line>
<line>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</line>
<line>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</line>
<line>I am determined to prove a villain</line>
<line>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</line>
<line>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</line>
<line>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</line>
<line>To set my brother Clarence and the king</line>
<line>In deadly hate the one against the other:</line>
<line>And if King Edward be as true and just</line>
<line>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</line>
<line>This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,</line>
<line>About a prophecy, which says that 'G'</line>
<line>Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.</line>
<line>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here</line>
<line>Clarence comes.</line>

<line>His majesty</line>

<speaker role="speaker">GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<line>Upon what cause?</line>

<speaker role="speaker">GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<line>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</line>
<line>He should, for that, commit your godfathers:</line>

<line>But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CLARENCE</speaker>
<line>Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest</line>
<line>As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,</line>
<line>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;</line>
<line>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.</line>
<line>And says a wizard told him that by G</line>
<line>His issue disinherited should be;</line>
<line>And, for my name of George begins with G,</line>
<line>It follows in his thought that I am he.</line>
<line>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</line>
<line>Have moved his highness to commit me now.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<line>Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:</line>

<line>That tempers him to this extremity.</line>
<line>Was it not she and that good man of worship,</line>
<line>Anthony Woodville, her brother there,</line>
<line>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</line>

<line>I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,</line>
<line>If we will keep in favour with the king,</line>
<line>To be her men and wear her livery:</line>
<line>The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,</line>
<line>Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<line>Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,</line>

<line>We speak no treason, man: we say the king</line>
<line>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</line>
<line>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</line>
<line>We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,</line>
<line>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</line>
<line>And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:</line>
<line>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</line>

<line>Clarence hath not another day to live:</line>
<line>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</line>
<line>And leave the world for me to bustle in!</line>
<line>For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.</line>
<line>What though I kill'd her husband and her father?</line>
<line>The readiest way to make the wench amends</line>
<line>Is to become her husband and her father:</line>

<line>You say that Edward is your brother's son:</line>

<line>Your mother lives a witness to that vow--</line>
<line>And afterward by substitute betroth'd</line>
<line>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</line>
<line>These both put by a poor petitioner,</line>
<line>A care-crazed mother of a many children,</line>
<line>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</line>
<line>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</line>
<line>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</line>
<line>Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</line>

<line>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</line>
<line>More bitterly could I expostulate,</line>

<line>Make bold her bashful years with your experience;</line>
<line>Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale</line>
<line>Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame</line>
<line>Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess</line>
<line>With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys</line>
<line>And when this arm of mine hath chastised</line>
