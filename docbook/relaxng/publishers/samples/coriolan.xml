<line>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</line>
<line>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</line>
<line>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</line>
<line>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</line>
<line>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</line>
<line>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</line>
<line>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</line>
<line>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</line>
<line>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</line>
<line>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,</line>
<line>You are transported by calamity</line>
<line>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</line>
<line>The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,</line>
<line>When you curse them as enemies.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup><speaker role="speaker">First Citizen</speaker>
<line>Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us</line>
<line>yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses</line>
<line>crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to</line>
<line>support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act</line>
<line>established against the rich, and provide more</line>
<line>piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain</line>
<line>the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and</line>
<line>there's all the love they bear us.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup><speaker role="speaker">MENENIUS</speaker>
<line>There was a time when all the body's members</line>
<line>Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:</line>
<line>That only like a gulf it did remain</line>
<line>I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,</line>
<line>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</line>
<line>Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments</line>
<line>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</line>
<line>And, mutually participate, did minister</line>
<line>Unto the appetite and affection common</line>
<line>Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--</line>

<line>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</line>

<line>For, look you, I may make the belly smile</line>
<line>As well as speak--it tauntingly replied</line>
<line>To the discontented members, the mutinous parts</line>
<line>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</line>

<line>Note me this, good friend;</line>

<line>'That I receive the general food at first,</line>
<line>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</line>
<line>Because I am the store-house and the shop</line>

<line>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</line>
<line>Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;</line>
<line>And, through the cranks and offices of man,</line>
<line>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</line>

<line>malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as</line>
<line>you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink</line>
<line>you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a</line>
<line>crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have</line>

<line>though I must be content to bear with those that say</line>
<line>you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that</line>
<line>tell you you have good faces. If you see this in</line>

<line>Most dignifies the haver: if it be,</line>
<line>The man I speak of cannot in the world</line>
<line>Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,</line>

<line>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</line>
<line>Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,</line>
<line>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</line>
<line>He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,</line>
<line>Before and in Corioli, let me say,</line>
<line>I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;</line>
<line>And by his rare example made the coward</line>

<line>A vessel under sail, so men obey'd</line>
<line>And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,</line>
<line>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</line>
<line>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</line>
<line>Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd</line>
<line>The mortal gate of the city, which he painted</line>
<line>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,</line>
<line>And with a sudden reinforcement struck</line>
<line>Corioli like a planet: now all's his:</line>
<line>When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce</line>
<line>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</line>
<line>Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,</line>

<line>To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,</line>

<line>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,</line>

<line>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd</line>
<line>Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation</line>
<line>Which they have often made against the senate,</line>
<line>All cause unborn, could never be the motive</line>

<line>How shall this bisson multitude digest</line>

<line>What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;</line>
<line>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</line>

<line>Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;</line>
<line>The cruelty and envy of the people,</line>
<line>Permitted by our dastard nobles, who</line>
<line>Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;</line>
<line>And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be</line>
<line>Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity</line>
<line>Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--</line>
<line>Mistake me not--to save my life, for if</line>
<line>I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world</line>
<line>I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,</line>
<line>To be full quit of those my banishers,</line>
<line>Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast</line>
<line>A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge</line>
<line>Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims</line>
<line>Of shame seen through thy country, speed</line>
<line>thee straight,</line>

<line>That my revengeful services may prove</line>

<line>Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,</line>

<line>Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son</line>

<line>stand bald before him: our general himself makes a</line>

<line>turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But</line>
<line>the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'</line>

<line>yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty</line>
<line>and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,</line>
