<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup><speaker role="speaker"/>
<line>In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</line>
<line>The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,</line>
<line>Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,</line>
<line>Fraught with the ministers and instruments</line>
<line>Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore</line>
<line>Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay</line>
<line>Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made</line>
<line>To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</line>
<line>The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,</line>
<line>With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.</line>
<line>To Tenedos they come;</line>
<line>And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</line>
<line>Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains</line>
<line>The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</line>
<line>Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,</line>
<line>Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,</line>
<line>And Antenorides, with massy staples</line>
<line>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,</line>
<line>Sperr up the sons of Troy.</line>
<line>Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,</line>
<line>On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,</line>
<line>Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come</line>
<line>A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence</line>
<line>Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited</line>
<line>In like conditions as our argument,</line>
<line>To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</line>
<line>Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,</line>
<line>Beginning in the middle, starting thence away</line>
<line>To what may be digested in a play.</line>
<line>Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:</line>
<line>Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.</line>

<line>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</line>
<line>I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,</line>
<line>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:</line>

<line>would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would</line>
<line>somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--</line>
<line>When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,</line>

<line>In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'</line>
<line>Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart</line>
<line>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</line>
<line>Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</line>
<line>In whose comparison all whites are ink,</line>
<line>Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure</line>
<line>The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense</line>
<line>Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,</line>
<line>As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;</line>
<line>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,</line>
<line>Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me</line>

<line>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,</line>
<line>And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,</line>
<line>But for these instances.</line>
<line>The specialty of rule hath been neglected:</line>
<line>And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand</line>
<line>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</line>
<line>When that the general is not like the hive</line>
<line>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</line>
<line>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</line>
<line>The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</line>
<line>The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre</line>
<line>Observe degree, priority and place,</line>
<line>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</line>
<line>Office and custom, in all line of order;</line>
<line>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</line>
<line>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered</line>
<line>Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye</line>
<line>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</line>
<line>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</line>
<line>Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets</line>
<line>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</line>
<line>What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!</line>
<line>What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!</line>
<line>Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,</line>
<line>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</line>
<line>The unity and married calm of states</line>
<line>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,</line>
<line>Which is the ladder to all high designs,</line>
<line>Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,</line>
<line>Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,</line>
<line>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</line>
<line>The primogenitive and due of birth,</line>
<line>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</line>
<line>But by degree, stand in authentic place?</line>
<line>Take but degree away, untune that string,</line>
<line>And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets</line>
<line>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</line>
<line>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores</line>
<line>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</line>
<line>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</line>
<line>And the rude son should strike his father dead:</line>
<line>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,</line>
<line>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</line>
<line>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</line>
<line>Then every thing includes itself in power,</line>
<line>Power into will, will into appetite;</line>
<line>And appetite, an universal wolf,</line>
<line>So doubly seconded with will and power,</line>
<line>Must make perforce an universal prey,</line>
<line>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</line>
<line>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</line>
<line>Follows the choking.</line>
<line>And this neglection of degree it is</line>
<line>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</line>
<line>It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd</line>
<line>By him one step below, he by the next,</line>
<line>That next by him beneath; so every step,</line>
<line>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</line>
<line>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</line>
<line>Of pale and bloodless emulation:</line>
<line>And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</line>

<line>Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus</line>

<line>Breaks scurril jests;</line>
<line>And with ridiculous and awkward action,</line>
<line>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</line>
<line>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</line>
<line>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</line>
<line>And, like a strutting player, whose conceit</line>
<line>Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</line>
<line>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</line>
<line>'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--</line>
<line>Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming</line>
<line>He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,</line>
<line>'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,</line>
<line>Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd</line>
<line>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</line>
<line>The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,</line>
<line>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;</line>
<line>Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.</line>
<line>Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,</line>
<line>As he being drest to some oration.'</line>
<line>That's done, as near as the extremest ends</line>
<line>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:</line>
<line>Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!</line>
<line>'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</line>
<line>Arming to answer in a night alarm.'</line>
<line>And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age</line>
<line>Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,</line>
<line>And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,</line>
<line>Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport</line>
<line>Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;</line>
<line>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</line>
<line>In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,</line>
<line>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</line>
<line>Severals and generals of grace exact,</line>
<line>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</line>
<line>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</line>

<line>Unfit to hear moral philosophy:</line>

<line>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</line>

<line>All dues be render'd to their owners: now,</line>
<line>What nearer debt in all humanity</line>
<line>Than wife is to the husband? If this law</line>
<line>Of nature be corrupted through affection,</line>
<line>And that great minds, of partial indulgence</line>
<line>To their benumbed wills, resist the same,</line>
<line>There is a law in each well-order'd nation</line>

<line>Most disobedient and refractory.</line>
<line>If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,</line>
