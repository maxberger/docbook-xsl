<line>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on</line>
<line>the like occasion whereon my services are now on</line>
<line>foot, you shall see, as I have said, great</line>
<line>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CAMILLO</speaker>
<line>I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia</line>
<line>means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<line>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be</line>
<line>justified in our loves; for indeed--</line>

<speaker role="speaker">CAMILLO</speaker>
<line>Beseech you,--</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<line>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:</line>
<line>we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know</line>
<line>not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,</line>
<line>that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,</line>
<line>may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse</line>
<line>us.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CAMILLO</speaker>
<line>You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<line>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me</line>
<line>and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CAMILLO</speaker>
<line>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.</line>
<line>They were trained together in their childhoods; and</line>
<line>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,</line>
<line>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their</line>
<line>more mature dignities and royal necessities made</line>
<line>separation of their society, their encounters,</line>
<line>though not personal, have been royally attorneyed</line>
<line>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving</line>
<line>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,</line>
<line>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and</line>
<line>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed</line>
<line>winds. The heavens continue their loves!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<line>I think there is not in the world either malice or</line>
<line>matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable</line>
<line>comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a</line>
<line>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came</line>
<line>into my note.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CAMILLO</speaker>
<line>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it</line>
<line>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the</line>
<line>subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on</line>
<line>crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to</line>
<line>see him a man.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<line>Would they else be content to die?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CAMILLO</speaker>
<line>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should</line>
<line>desire to live.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<line>If the king had no son, they would desire to live</line>
<line>on crutches till he had one.</line>

<line>So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,</line>

<line>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</line>

<line>But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</line>
<line>We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.</line>
<line>Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure</line>
<line>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</line>
<line>You take my lord, I'll give him my commission</line>
<line>To let him there a month behind the gest</line>

<line>I may not, verily.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HERMIONE</speaker>
<line>Verily!</line>
<line>You put me off with limber vows; but I,</line>
<line>Though you would seek to unsphere the</line>
<line>stars with oaths,</line>
<line>Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,</line>
<line>You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's</line>
<line>As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?</line>
<line>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</line>
<line>Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees</line>
<line>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</line>
<line>My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">POLIXENES</speaker>
<line>Your guest, then, madam:</line>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HERMIONE</speaker>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">POLIXENES</speaker>
<line>We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,</line>
<line>And bleat the one at the other: what we changed</line>
<line>Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</line>
<line>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd</line>
<line>That any did. Had we pursued that life,</line>
<line>And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd</line>
<line>With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven</line>

<line>The offences we have made you do we'll answer,</line>

<line>What! have I twice said well? when was't before?</line>
<line>I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's</line>
<line>As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless</line>
<line>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</line>
<line>Our praises are our wages: you may ride's</line>
<line>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</line>
<line>With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:</line>
<line>My last good deed was to entreat his stay:</line>
<line>What was my first? it has an elder sister,</line>
<line>Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!</line>
<line>But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?</line>
<line>Nay, let me have't; I long.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>Why, that was when</line>
<line>Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,</line>
<line>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand</line>
<line>And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter</line>
<line>'I am yours for ever.'</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HERMIONE</speaker>
<line>'Tis grace indeed.</line>
<line>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:</line>
<line>The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;</line>
<line>The other for some while a friend.</line>

<line>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</line>

<line>No, in good earnest.</line>
<line>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,</line>

<line>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,</line>
<line>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,</line>
<line>Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,</line>
<line>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:</line>

<line>Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What</line>
<line>his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I</line>
<line>have missingly noted, he is of late much retired</line>
<line>from court and is less frequent to his princely</line>
<line>exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">POLIXENES</speaker>
<line>I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some</line>
<line>care; so far that I have eyes under my service which</line>
<line>look upon his removedness; from whom I have this</line>
<line>intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a</line>
<line>most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from</line>
<line>very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his</line>
<line>neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</line>

<line>appearing what we are, have some question with the</line>
<line>shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not</line>
<line>uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.</line>
<line>Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and</line>
<line>lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</line>

<line>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</line>
<line>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</line>
<line>know to be his character, the majesty of the</line>
<line>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</line>
<line>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</line>
<line>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</line>

<line>No.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Third Gentleman</speaker>
<line>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</line>
<line>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</line>
<line>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</line>
<line>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</line>
<line>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</line>
<line>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</line>
<line>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</line>
<line>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</line>
<line>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</line>
<line>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</line>
<line>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</line>
<line>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</line>
<line>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</line>
<line>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</line>
<line>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such</line>

<line>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble</line>
<line>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</line>
<line>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</line>
<line>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</line>
<line>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</line>
<line>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</line>

<line>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely</line>
<line>confessed and lamented by the king, how</line>
<line>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one</line>
<line>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'</line>
<line>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</line>
<line>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed</line>

<line>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her</line>
<line>As she lived now.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>As now she might have done,</line>
<line>So much to my good comfort, as it is</line>
<line>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</line>
<line>Even with such life of majesty, warm life,</line>
<line>As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!</line>
<line>I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me</line>
<line>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</line>
<line>There's magic in thy majesty, which has</line>
<line>My evils conjured to remembrance and</line>
<line>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</line>
<line>Standing like stone with thee.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PERDITA</speaker>
<line>And give me leave,</line>
<line>And do not say 'tis superstition, that</line>
<line>I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,</line>
<line>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</line>
<line>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>O, patience!</line>
<line>The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CAMILLO</speaker>
<line>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</line>
<line>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,</line>
<line>So many summers dry; scarce any joy</line>
<line>Did ever so long live; no sorrow</line>
<line>But kill'd itself much sooner.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">POLIXENES</speaker>
<line>Dear my brother,</line>
<line>Let him that was the cause of this have power</line>
<line>To take off so much grief from you as he</line>
<line>Will piece up in himself.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>Indeed, my lord,</line>
<line>If I had thought the sight of my poor image</line>
<line>Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--</line>
<line>I'ld not have show'd it.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>Do not draw the curtain.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy</line>
<line>May think anon it moves.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>Let be, let be.</line>
<line>Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--</line>
<line>What was he that did make it? See, my lord,</line>
<line>Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins</line>
<line>Did verily bear blood?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">POLIXENES</speaker>
<line>Masterly done:</line>
<line>The very life seems warm upon her lip.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>The fixture of her eye has motion in't,</line>
<line>As we are mock'd with art.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>I'll draw the curtain:</line>
<line>My lord's almost so far transported that</line>
<line>He'll think anon it lives.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>O sweet Paulina,</line>
<line>Make me to think so twenty years together!</line>
<line>No settled senses of the world can match</line>
<line>The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but</line>
<line>I could afflict you farther.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>Do, Paulina;</line>
<line>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</line>
<line>As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,</line>
<line>There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel</line>
<line>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</line>
<line>For I will kiss her.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>Good my lord, forbear:</line>
<line>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</line>
<line>You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own</line>
<line>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>No, not these twenty years.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PERDITA</speaker>
<line>So long could I</line>
<line>Stand by, a looker on.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>Either forbear,</line>
<line>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</line>
<line>For more amazement. If you can behold it,</line>
<line>I'll make the statue move indeed, descend</line>
<line>And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--</line>
<line>Which I protest against--I am assisted</line>
<line>By wicked powers.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>What you can make her do,</line>
<line>I am content to look on: what to speak,</line>
<line>I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy</line>
<line>To make her speak as move.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>It is required</line>
<line>You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;</line>
<line>On: those that think it is unlawful business</line>
<line>I am about, let them depart.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>Proceed:</line>

<line>Music, awake her; strike!</line>
<para role="stagedir">Music</para>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>That she is living,</line>
<line>Were it but told you, should be hooted at</line>
<line>Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,</line>

<line>Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel</line>

<line>You gods, look down</line>

<line>Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,</line>

<line>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAULINA</speaker>
<line>There's time enough for that;</line>
<line>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble</line>
<line>Your joys with like relation. Go together,</line>

<line>Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,</line>

<speaker role="speaker">LEONTES</speaker>
<line>O, peace, Paulina!</line>
<line>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</line>
<line>As I by thine a wife: this is a match,</line>
<line>And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;</line>
<line>But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,</line>
<line>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many</line>
<line>A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--</line>
<line>For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee</line>
<line>An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,</line>
<line>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</line>
<line>Is richly noted and here justified</line>
<line>By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.</line>
<line>What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,</line>
<line>That e'er I put between your holy looks</line>
<line>My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,</line>
<line>And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,</line>
<line>Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,</line>
<line>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</line>
<line>Each one demand an answer to his part</line>
<line>Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first</line>
<line>We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.</line>
