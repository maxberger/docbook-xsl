<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROSPERO</speaker>
<line>My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--</line>
<line>I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should</line>
<line>Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself</line>
<line>Of all the world I loved and to him put</line>
<line>The manage of my state; as at that time</line>
<line>Through all the signories it was the first</line>
<line>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</line>
<line>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</line>
<line>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</line>
<line>The government I cast upon my brother</line>
<line>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</line>
<line>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--</line>
<line>Dost thou attend me?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">MIRANDA</speaker>
<line>Sir, most heedfully.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROSPERO</speaker>
<line>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</line>
<line>How to deny them, who to advance and who</line>
<line>To trash for over-topping, new created</line>
<line>The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,</line>
<line>Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key</line>
<line>Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state</line>
<line>To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was</line>
<line>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</line>
<line>And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">MIRANDA</speaker>
<line>O, good sir, I do.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROSPERO</speaker>
<line>I pray thee, mark me.</line>
<line>I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</line>
<line>To closeness and the bettering of my mind</line>
<line>With that which, but by being so retired,</line>
<line>O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother</line>
<line>Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,</line>
<line>Like a good parent, did beget of him</line>
<line>A falsehood in its contrary as great</line>
<line>As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,</line>
<line>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</line>
<line>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</line>
<line>But what my power might else exact, like one</line>
<line>Who having into truth, by telling of it,</line>
<line>Made such a sinner of his memory,</line>
<line>To credit his own lie, he did believe</line>
<line>He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution</line>
<line>And executing the outward face of royalty,</line>
<line>With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--</line>
<line>Dost thou hear?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">MIRANDA</speaker>
<line>Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROSPERO</speaker>
<line>To have no screen between this part he play'd</line>
<line>And him he play'd it for, he needs will be</line>
<line>Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library</line>
<line>Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties</line>
<line>He thinks me now incapable; confederates--</line>
<line>So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples</line>
<line>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</line>
<line>Subject his coronet to his crown and bend</line>
<line>The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--</line>
<line>To most ignoble stooping.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<speaker role="speaker">MIRANDA</speaker>
<line>O the heavens!</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROSPERO</speaker>
<line>Now the condition.</line>
<line>The King of Naples, being an enemy</line>
<line>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;</line>
<line>Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises</line>
<line>Of homage and I know not how much tribute,</line>
<line>Should presently extirpate me and mine</line>
<line>Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan</line>
<line>With all the honours on my brother: whereon,</line>
<line>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</line>
<line>Fated to the purpose did Antonio open</line>
<line>The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,</line>
<line>The ministers for the purpose hurried thence</line>
<line>Me and thy crying self.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">MIRANDA</speaker>
<line>Alack, for pity!</line>
<line>I, not remembering how I cried out then,</line>

<speaker role="speaker">PROSPERO</speaker>
<line>Hear a little further</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<speaker role="speaker">PROSPERO</speaker>
<line>Well demanded, wench:</line>
<line>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,</line>
<line>So dear the love my people bore me, nor set</line>
<line>A mark so bloody on the business, but</line>
<line>With colours fairer painted their foul ends.</line>
<line>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</line>
<line>Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared</line>
<line>A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,</line>
<line>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats</line>
<line>Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,</line>
<line>To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh</line>
<line>To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,</line>
<line>Did us but loving wrong.</line>

<line>O, a cherubim</line>
<line>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.</line>
<line>Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</line>
<line>When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,</line>
<line>Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me</line>

<line>Against what should ensue.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">MIRANDA</speaker>
<line>How came we ashore?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROSPERO</speaker>
<line>By Providence divine.</line>
<line>Some food we had and some fresh water that</line>
<line>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</line>
<line>Out of his charity, being then appointed</line>
<line>Master of this design, did give us, with</line>
<line>Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,</line>
<line>Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,</line>
<line>Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me</line>
<line>From mine own library with volumes that</line>
<line>I prize above my dukedom.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<line>As many vouched rarities are.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GONZALO</speaker>
<line>That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in</line>

<line>how you take it!</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ADRIAN</speaker>
<line>'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:</line>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GONZALO</speaker>
<line>This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</line>

<line>Carthage?</line>

<line>I assure you, Carthage.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<line>His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath</line>
<line>raised the wall and houses too.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>What impossible matter will he make easy next?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<line>I think he will carry this island home in his pocket</line>
<line>and give it his son for an apple.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring</line>
<line>forth more islands.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GONZALO</speaker>
<line>Ay.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>Why, in good time.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GONZALO</speaker>
<line>Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now</line>
<line>as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage</line>
<line>of your daughter, who is now queen.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>And the rarest that e'er came there.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<line>Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GONZALO</speaker>
<line>Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I</line>
<line>wore it? I mean, in a sort.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ANTONIO</speaker>
<line>That sort was well fished for.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GONZALO</speaker>
<line>When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ALONSO</speaker>
<line>You cram these words into mine ears against</line>

<line>Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,</line>
<line>My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,</line>
<line>Who is so far from Italy removed</line>
<line>I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</line>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FRANCISCO</speaker>
<line>Sir, he may live:</line>
<line>I saw him beat the surges under him,</line>
<line>And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,</line>
<line>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</line>
<line>The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head</line>
<line>'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd</line>
<line>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</line>
<line>To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,</line>
<line>As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt</line>
<line>He came alive to land.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ALONSO</speaker>
<line>No, no, he's gone.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<line>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</line>
<line>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</line>
<line>But rather lose her to an African;</line>
<line>Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,</line>
<line>Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ALONSO</speaker>
<line>Prithee, peace.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<line>You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise</line>
<line>By all of us, and the fair soul herself</line>
<line>Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at</line>
<line>Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your</line>
<line>son,</line>
<line>I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have</line>
<line>More widows in them of this business' making</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GONZALO</speaker>
<line>I' the commonwealth I would by contraries</line>

<line>All things in common nature should produce</line>
