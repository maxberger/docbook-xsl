<line>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</line>
<line>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</line>
<line>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</line>
<line>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</line>
<line>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</line>
<line>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</line>
<line>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</line>
<line>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</line>
<line>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</line>
<line>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</line>
<line>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</line>
<line>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</line>
<line>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</line>
<line>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</line>
<line>which his animals on his dunghills are as much</line>
<line>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</line>
<line>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</line>
<line>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</line>
<line>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</line>
<line>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</line>
<line>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</line>
<line>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</line>
<line>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</line>
<line>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</line>
<line>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</line>

<line>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</line>
<line>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</line>
<line>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</line>
<line>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</line>

<line>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</line>
<line>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</line>
<line>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and</line>
<line>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</line>
<line>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:</line>
<line>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</line>
<line>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</line>
<line>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</line>
<line>me his natural brother: therefore use thy</line>
<line>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</line>
<line>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if</line>
<line>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</line>
<line>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</line>
<line>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</line>
<line>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</line>
<line>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;</line>
<line>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</line>
<line>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</line>
<line>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</line>
<line>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</line>

<line>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</line>

<line>Indeed, my lord,</line>

<line>To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself</line>
<line>Did steal behind him as he lay along</line>
<line>Under an oak whose antique root peeps out</line>
<line>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:</line>
<line>To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,</line>
<line>That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,</line>
<line>Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,</line>
<line>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans</line>
<line>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</line>
<line>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</line>
<line>Coursed one another down his innocent nose</line>
<line>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool</line>

<line>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</line>
<line>To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,</line>
<line>Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,</line>
<line>''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part</line>
<line>The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,</line>
<line>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</line>
<line>And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,</line>
<line>'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;</line>
<line>'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look</line>
<line>Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'</line>
<line>Thus most invectively he pierceth through</line>
<line>The body of the country, city, court,</line>
<line>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</line>
<line>Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,</line>

<line>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I</line>
<line>like it very well; but in respect that it is</line>
<line>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</line>
<line>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</line>
<line>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</line>
<line>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</line>
<line>but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</line>
<line>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ROSALIND</speaker>
<line>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old</line>
<line>religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was</line>
<line>in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship</line>
<line>too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard</line>
<line>him read many lectures against it, and I thank God</line>
<line>I am not a woman, to be touched with so many</line>

<line>No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that</line>
<line>are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that</line>
<line>abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on</line>
<line>their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies</line>
<line>on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of</line>
<line>Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would</line>
<line>give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the</line>
<line>quotidian of love upon him.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<speaker role="speaker">ROSALIND</speaker>
<line>There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ORLANDO</speaker>
<line>What were his marks?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ROSALIND</speaker>
<line>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and</line>
<line>sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable</line>
<line>spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,</line>
<line>which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for</line>
<line>simply your having in beard is a younger brother's</line>
<line>revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your</line>
<line>bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe</line>
<line>untied and every thing about you demonstrating a</line>
<line>careless desolation; but you are no such man; you</line>
<line>are rather point-device in your accoutrements as</line>

<line>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</line>

<line>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you</line>

<line>do than to confess she does: that is one of the</line>
<line>points in the which women still give the lie to</line>

<speaker role="speaker">ORLANDO</speaker>
<line>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ROSALIND</speaker>
<line>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves</line>
<line>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and</line>
<line>the reason why they are not so punished and cured</line>
<line>is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers</line>
<line>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ORLANDO</speaker>
<line>Did you ever cure any so?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ROSALIND</speaker>
<line>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me</line>
<line>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to</line>
<line>woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish</line>
<line>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing</line>
<line>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,</line>
<line>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every</line>
<line>passion something and for no passion truly any</line>
<line>thing, as boys and women are for the most part</line>
<line>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe</line>
<line>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep</line>
<line>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor</line>
<line>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of</line>
<line>madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of</line>
<line>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.</line>
<line>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon</line>
<line>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's</line>
<line>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>I would not be cured, youth.</line>

<line>I have more cause to hate him than to love him:</line>

<line>taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish</line>

<line>Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more</line>
<line>seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the</line>
<line>cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,</line>
<line>if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the</line>
<line>mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.</line>
<line>If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he</line>
<line>would send me word, he cut it to please himself:</line>
<line>this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was</line>
<line>not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is</line>
<line>called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not</line>
<line>well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this</line>
<line>is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not</line>
<line>well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the</line>
<line>Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie</line>
<line>Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<line>I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,</line>

<line>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<line>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have</line>
<line>books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.</line>
<line>The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the</line>
<line>Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the</line>
<line>fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the</line>
<line>Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with</line>
<line>Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All</line>
<line>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may</line>
<line>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven</line>
<line>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the</line>
<line>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but</line>
<line>of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and</line>
<line>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the</line>
<line>only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</line>

<line>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;</line>
<line>but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord</line>
<line>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</line>
<line>no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no</line>
<line>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</line>
<line>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</line>
<line>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</line>
<line>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</line>
<line>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</line>
<line>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</line>
<line>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin</line>
<line>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</line>
<line>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</line>
<line>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</line>
<line>you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,</line>
<line>none of you hates them--that between you and the</line>
<line>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</line>
<line>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</line>
<line>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</line>
<line>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</line>
<line>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</line>
<line>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</line>
