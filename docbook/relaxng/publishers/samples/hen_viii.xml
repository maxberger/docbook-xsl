<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup><speaker role="speaker"/>
<line>I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</line>
<line>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</line>
<line>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</line>
<line>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</line>
<line>We now present. Those that can pity, here</line>
<line>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</line>
<line>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</line>
<line>Their money out of hope they may believe,</line>
<line>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</line>
<line>Only a show or two, and so agree</line>
<line>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</line>
<line>I'll undertake may see away their shilling</line>
<line>Richly in two short hours. Only they</line>
<line>That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</line>
<line>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</line>
<line>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</line>
<line>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</line>
<line>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</line>
<line>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</line>
<line>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</line>
<line>To make that only true we now intend,</line>
<line>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</line>
<line>Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</line>
<line>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</line>
<line>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</line>
<line>The very persons of our noble story</line>
<line>As they were living; think you see them great,</line>
<line>And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</line>
<line>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</line>
<line>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</line>
<line>And, if you can be merry then, I'll say</line>
<line>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done</line>
<line>Since last we saw in France?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>An untimely ague</line>
<line>Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when</line>
<line>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</line>
<line>Met in the vale of Andren.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>
<line>'Twixt Guynes and Arde:</line>
<line>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;</line>
<line>Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung</line>

<line>Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd</line>
<line>Such a compounded one?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>All the whole time</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>
<line>Then you lost</line>
<line>The view of earthly glory: men might say,</line>
<line>Till this time pomp was single, but now married</line>
<line>To one above itself. Each following day</line>
<line>Became the next day's master, till the last</line>
<line>Made former wonders its. To-day the French,</line>
<line>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</line>
<line>Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they</line>
<line>Made Britain India: every man that stood</line>
<line>Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</line>
<line>As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,</line>
<line>Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</line>
<line>The pride upon them, that their very labour</line>
<line>Was to them as a painting: now this masque</line>
<line>Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night</line>
<line>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</line>
<line>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</line>
<line>As presence did present them; him in eye,</line>
<line>Still him in praise: and, being present both</line>
<line>'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner</line>
<line>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--</line>
<line>For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged</line>
<line>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</line>
<line>Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,</line>
<line>Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</line>
<line>That Bevis was believed.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>O, you go far.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>
<line>As I belong to worship and affect</line>
<line>In honour honesty, the tract of every thing</line>
<line>Would by a good discourser lose some life,</line>
<line>Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;</line>
<line>To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.</line>
<line>Order gave each thing view; the office did</line>
<line>Distinctly his full function.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>Who did guide,</line>
<line>I mean, who set the body and the limbs</line>
<line>Of this great sport together, as you guess?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>
<line>One, certes, that promises no element</line>
<line>In such a business.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>I pray you, who, my lord?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>
<line>All this was order'd by the good discretion</line>
<line>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed</line>
<line>From his ambitious finger. What had he</line>
<line>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</line>
<line>That such a keech can with his very bulk</line>
<line>Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun</line>
<line>And keep it from the earth.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>
<line>Surely, sir,</line>
<line>There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</line>
<line>For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace</line>
<line>Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon</line>
<line>For high feats done to the crown; neither allied</line>
<line>For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,</line>
<line>Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,</line>
<line>The force of his own merit makes his way</line>
<line>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</line>
<line>A place next to the king.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ABERGAVENNY</speaker>
<line>I cannot tell</line>
<line>What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye</line>
<line>Pierce into that; but I can see his pride</line>
<line>Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,</line>
<line>If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,</line>
<line>Or has given all before, and he begins</line>
<line>A new hell in himself.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>Why the devil,</line>
<line>Upon this French going out, took he upon him,</line>
<line>Without the privity o' the king, to appoint</line>
<line>Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</line>
<line>Of all the gentry; for the most part such</line>
<line>To whom as great a charge as little honour</line>
<line>He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,</line>
<line>The honourable board of council out,</line>
<line>Must fetch him in the papers.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ABERGAVENNY</speaker>
<line>I do know</line>
<line>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</line>
<line>By this so sickened their estates, that never</line>
<line>They shall abound as formerly.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>O, many</line>
<line>Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em</line>
<line>For this great journey. What did this vanity</line>
<line>But minister communication of</line>
<line>A most poor issue?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>
<line>Grievingly I think,</line>
<line>The peace between the French and us not values</line>
<line>The cost that did conclude it.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>Every man,</line>
<line>After the hideous storm that follow'd, was</line>
<line>A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke</line>
<line>Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,</line>
<line>Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded</line>
<line>The sudden breach on't.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ABERGAVENNY</speaker>
<line>Is it therefore</line>
<line>The ambassador is silenced?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">NORFOLK</speaker>
<line>Like it your grace,</line>
<line>The state takes notice of the private difference</line>
<line>Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--</line>
<line>And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</line>
<line>Honour and plenteous safety--that you read</line>
<line>The cardinal's malice and his potency</line>
<line>Together; to consider further that</line>
<line>What his high hatred would effect wants not</line>
<line>A minister in his power. You know his nature,</line>
<line>That he's revengeful, and I know his sword</line>
<line>Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,</line>
<line>It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,</line>
<line>Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,</line>
<line>You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock</line>
<line>That I advise your shunning.</line>

<line>From sincere motions, by intelligence,</line>
<line>And proofs as clear as founts in July when</line>
<line>We see each grain of gravel, I do know</line>

<line>As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief</line>
<line>As able to perform't; his mind and place</line>
<line>Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--</line>
<line>Only to show his pomp as well in France</line>
<line>As here at home, suggests the king our master</line>
<line>To this last costly treaty, the interview,</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<line>Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal</line>
<line>The articles o' the combination drew</line>
<line>As himself pleased; and they were ratified</line>
<line>As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end</line>
<line>As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal</line>
<line>Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,</line>
<line>Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--</line>
<line>Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</line>
<line>To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,</line>
<line>Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--</line>
<line>For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came</line>
<line>To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:</line>
<line>His fears were, that the interview betwixt</line>
<line>England and France might, through their amity,</line>
<line>Breed him some prejudice; for from this league</line>
<line>Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily</line>
<line>Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--</line>
<line>Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor</line>
<line>Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted</line>
<line>Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,</line>
<line>And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,</line>
<line>That he would please to alter the king's course,</line>
<line>And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,</line>
<line>As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal</line>
<line>Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,</line>
<line>And for his own advantage.</line>

<line>I am solicited, not by a few,</line>
<line>And those of true condition, that your subjects</line>
<line>Are in great grievance: there have been commissions</line>
<line>Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart</line>
<line>Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,</line>
<line>My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches</line>
<line>Most bitterly on you, as putter on</line>

<line>Not almost appears,</line>
<line>It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,</line>

<line>The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,</line>
<line>Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger</line>

<speaker role="speaker">QUEEN KATHARINE</speaker>
<line>No, my lord,</line>
<line>You know no more than others; but you frame</line>
<line>Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome</line>
<line>To those which would not know them, and yet must</line>
<line>Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,</line>
<line>Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are</line>
<line>Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,</line>
<line>The back is sacrifice to the load. They say</line>

<speaker role="speaker">QUEEN KATHARINE</speaker>
<line>I am much too venturous</line>

<line>Without delay; and the pretence for this</line>
<line>Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:</line>
<line>Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</line>
<line>Allegiance in them; their curses now</line>
<line>Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,</line>
<line>This tractable obedience is a slave</line>

<line>Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know</line>
<line>My faculties nor person, yet will be</line>
<line>The chronicles of my doing, let me say</line>
<line>'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</line>
<line>That virtue must go through. We must not stint</line>
<line>Our necessary actions, in the fear</line>
<line>To cope malicious censurers; which ever,</line>
<line>As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow</line>
<line>That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further</line>

<line>By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is</line>
<line>Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,</line>
<line>Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up</line>

<speaker role="speaker">Surveyor</speaker>
<line>Not long before your highness sped to France,</line>
<line>The duke being at the Rose, within the parish</line>

<line>What was the speech among the Londoners</line>
<line>Concerning the French journey: I replied,</line>
<line>Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,</line>
<line>To the king's danger. Presently the duke</line>
<line>Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted</line>
<line>'Twould prove the verity of certain words</line>
<line>Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,</line>
<line>'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit</line>
<line>John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour</line>
<line>To hear from him a matter of some moment:</line>
<line>Whom after under the confession's seal</line>
<line>He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke</line>
<line>My chaplain to no creature living, but</line>
<line>To me, should utter, with demure confidence</line>
<line>This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,</line>

<line>On my soul, I'll speak but truth.</line>

<line>The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him</line>
<line>To ruminate on this so far, until</line>
<line>It forged him some design, which, being believed,</line>
<line>It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,</line>
<line>It can do me no damage;' adding further,</line>

<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>I'll tell you in a little. The great duke</line>
<line>Came to the bar; where to his accusations</line>
<line>He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</line>
<line>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</line>
<line>The king's attorney on the contrary</line>
<line>Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</line>
<line>Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired</line>
<line>To have brought viva voce to his face:</line>
<line>At which appear'd against him his surveyor;</line>
<line>Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,</line>
<line>Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,</line>
<line>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>The same.</line>
<line>All these accused him strongly; which he fain</line>
<line>Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:</line>
<line>And so his peers, upon this evidence,</line>
<line>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</line>
<line>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</line>
<line>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Second Gentleman</speaker>
<line>After all this, how did he bear himself?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>When he was brought again to the bar, to hear</line>
<line>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd</line>
<line>With such an agony, he sweat extremely,</line>
<line>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:</line>
<line>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</line>
<line>In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>I do not think he fears death.</line>

<line>Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all</line>

<line>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;</line>

<line>Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,</line>
<line>Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry</line>

<line>I ever contradicted your desire,</line>
<line>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends</line>
<line>Have I not strove to love, although I knew</line>
<line>He were mine enemy? what friend of mine</line>
<line>That had to him derived your anger, did I</line>
<line>Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice</line>
<line>He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind</line>
<line>That I have been your wife, in this obedience,</line>
<line>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest</line>
<line>With many children by you: if, in the course</line>

<line>My lord cardinal,</line>
<line>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,</line>
<line>I free you from't. You are not to be taught</line>
<line>That you have many enemies, that know not</line>
<line>Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,</line>
<line>Bark when their fellows do: by some of these</line>
<line>The queen is put in anger. You're excused:</line>
<line>But will you be more justified? You ever</line>
<line>Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired</line>
<line>It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,</line>
<line>The passages made toward it: on my honour,</line>
<line>I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,</line>
<line>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,</line>
<line>I will be bold with time and your attention:</line>
<line>Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:</line>
<line>My conscience first received a tenderness,</line>
<line>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</line>
<line>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</line>
<line>Who had been hither sent on the debating</line>
<line>A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</line>
<line>Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,</line>
<line>Ere a determinate resolution, he,</line>
<line>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</line>
<line>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</line>
<line>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</line>
<line>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</line>
<line>Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook</line>
<line>The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</line>
<line>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</line>
<line>The region of my breast; which forced such way,</line>
<line>That many mazed considerings did throng</line>
<line>And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</line>
<line>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</line>
<line>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</line>
<line>If it conceived a male child by me, should</line>
<line>Do no more offices of life to't than</line>
<line>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</line>
<line>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</line>
<line>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</line>
<line>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</line>
<line>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</line>
<line>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</line>
<line>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</line>
<line>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</line>
<line>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</line>
<line>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</line>
<line>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</line>
<line>Now present here together: that's to say,</line>
<line>I meant to rectify my conscience,--which</line>
<line>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--</line>
<line>By all the reverend fathers of the land</line>
<line>And doctors learn'd: first I began in private</line>
<line>With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember</line>

<line>Yes; 'tis the list</line>

<line>By custom of the coronation.</line>
<line>The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims</line>
<line>To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,</line>

<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>That I can tell you too. The Archbishop</line>
<line>Of Canterbury, accompanied with other</line>
<line>Learned and reverend fathers of his order,</line>
<line>Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off</line>
<line>From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which</line>
<line>She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:</line>
<line>And, to be short, for not appearance and</line>
<line>The king's late scruple, by the main assent</line>
<line>Of all these learned men she was divorced,</line>
<line>And the late marriage made of none effect</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Third Gentleman</speaker>
<line>As well as I am able. The rich stream</line>
<line>Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen</line>
<line>To a prepared place in the choir, fell off</line>
<line>A distance from her; while her grace sat down</line>
<line>To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,</line>
<line>In a rich chair of state, opposing freely</line>
<line>The beauty of her person to the people.</line>
<line>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman</line>
<line>That ever lay by man: which when the people</line>
<line>Had the full view of, such a noise arose</line>
<line>As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,</line>

<line>I never saw before. Great-bellied women,</line>
<line>That had not half a week to go, like rams</line>
<line>In the old time of war, would shake the press,</line>
<line>And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living</line>

<line>At length her grace rose, and with modest paces</line>
<line>Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like</line>
<line>Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.</line>
<line>Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:</line>
<line>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</line>
<line>She had all the royal makings of a queen;</line>
<line>As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,</line>
<line>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems</line>
<line>Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,</line>
<line>With all the choicest music of the kingdom,</line>
<line>Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,</line>
<line>And with the same full state paced back again</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GRIFFITH</speaker>
<line>Well, the voice goes, madam:</line>
<line>For after the stout Earl Northumberland</line>
<line>Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,</line>
<line>As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,</line>
<line>He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill</line>
<line>He could not sit his mule.</line>

<line>Alas, poor man!</line>

<speaker role="speaker">GRIFFITH</speaker>
<line>At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,</line>
<line>Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,</line>
<line>With all his covent, honourably received him;</line>
<line>To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,</line>
<line>An old man, broken with the storms of state,</line>
<line>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;</line>
<line>Give him a little earth for charity!'</line>
<line>So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness</line>
<line>Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,</line>
<line>About the hour of eight, which he himself</line>
<line>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</line>
<line>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,</line>
<line>He gave his honours to the world again,</line>
<line>His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">KATHARINE</speaker>
<line>So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!</line>
<line>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,</line>
<line>And yet with charity. He was a man</line>
<line>Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking</line>
<line>Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,</line>
<line>Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;</line>
<line>His own opinion was his law: i' the presence</line>
<line>He would say untruths; and be ever double</line>
<line>Both in his words and meaning: he was never,</line>
<line>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:</line>
<line>His promises were, as he then was, mighty;</line>
<line>But his performance, as he is now, nothing:</line>
<line>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</line>
<line>The clergy in example.</line>

<line>In which I have commended to his goodness</line>
<line>The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;</line>
<line>The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!</line>
<line>Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--</line>
<line>She is young, and of a noble modest nature,</line>
<line>I hope she will deserve well,--and a little</line>
<line>To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,</line>
<line>Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition</line>
<line>Is, that his noble grace would have some pity</line>
<line>Upon my wretched women, that so long</line>
<line>Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:</line>
<line>Of which there is not one, I dare avow,</line>
<line>And now I should not lie, but will deserve</line>
<line>For virtue and true beauty of the soul,</line>
<line>For honesty and decent carriage,</line>
<line>A right good husband, let him be a noble</line>
<line>And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.</line>
<line>The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,</line>
<line>But poverty could never draw 'em from me;</line>
<line>That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,</line>
<line>And something over to remember me by:</line>
<line>If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life</line>
<line>And able means, we had not parted thus.</line>
<line>These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,</line>
<line>By that you love the dearest in this world,</line>
<line>As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,</line>
<line>Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king</line>
<line>To do me this last right.</line>

<line>My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry</line>
<line>To sit here at this present, and behold</line>
<line>That chair stand empty: but we all are men,</line>
<line>In our own natures frail, and capable</line>
<line>Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty</line>
<line>And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,</line>
<line>Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,</line>
<line>Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling</line>
<line>The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,</line>
<line>For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,</line>
<line>Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,</line>
<line>And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">GARDINER</speaker>
<line>Which reformation must be sudden too,</line>
<line>My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses</line>
<line>Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,</line>
<line>But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,</line>
<line>Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,</line>
<line>Out of our easiness and childish pity</line>
<line>To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,</line>
<line>Farewell all physic: and what follows then?</line>
<line>Commotions, uproars, with a general taint</line>
<line>Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,</line>
<line>The upper Germany, can dearly witness,</line>
<line>Yet freshly pitied in our memories.</line>

<line>Might go one way, and safely; and the end</line>

<line>I speak it with a single heart, my lords,</line>

<line>My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:</line>

<line>Let me speak, sir,</line>
<line>For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter</line>
<line>Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.</line>
<line>This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--</line>
<line>Though in her cradle, yet now promises</line>
<line>Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</line>
<line>Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--</line>
<line>But few now living can behold that goodness--</line>
<line>A pattern to all princes living with her,</line>
<line>And all that shall succeed: Saba was never</line>
<line>More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue</line>
<line>Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,</line>
<line>That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,</line>
<line>With all the virtues that attend the good,</line>
<line>Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,</line>
<line>Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:</line>
<line>She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;</line>
<line>Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,</line>
<line>And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:</line>
<line>In her days every man shall eat in safety,</line>
<line>Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing</line>
<line>The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:</line>
<line>God shall be truly known; and those about her</line>
<line>From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,</line>
<line>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</line>
<line>Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when</line>
<line>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</line>
<line>Her ashes new create another heir,</line>
<line>As great in admiration as herself;</line>
<line>So shall she leave her blessedness to one,</line>
<line>When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,</line>
<line>Who from the sacred ashes of her honour</line>
<line>Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,</line>
<line>And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</line>
<line>That were the servants to this chosen infant,</line>
<line>Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:</line>
<line>Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</line>
<line>His honour and the greatness of his name</line>
<line>Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,</line>
<line>And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches</line>
<line>To all the plains about him: our children's children</line>
<line>Shall see this, and bless heaven.</line>

<line>She shall be, to the happiness of England,</line>

<line>Would I had known no more! but she must die,</line>
<line>She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,</line>
<line>A most unspotted lily shall she pass</line>
<line>To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.</line>

<line>O lord archbishop,</line>
<line>Thou hast made me now a man! never, before</line>
<line>This happy child, did I get any thing:</line>
<line>This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,</line>
<line>That when I am in heaven I shall desire</line>
<line>To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.</line>
<line>I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,</line>
<line>And your good brethren, I am much beholding;</line>
<line>I have received much honour by your presence,</line>
<line>And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:</line>
<line>Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,</line>
<line>She will be sick else. This day, no man think</line>
<line>Has business at his house; for all shall stay:</line>
<line>This little one shall make it holiday.</line>

<line>'Tis ten to one this play can never please</line>
<line>All that are here: some come to take their ease,</line>
<line>And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,</line>
<line>We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,</line>
<line>They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city</line>
<line>Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'</line>
<line>Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,</line>
<line>All the expected good we're like to hear</line>
<line>For this play at this time, is only in</line>
<line>The merciful construction of good women;</line>
<line>For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,</line>
<line>And say 'twill do, I know, within a while</line>
<line>All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,</line>
<line>If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.</line>
