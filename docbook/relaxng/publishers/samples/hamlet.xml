<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">MARCELLUS</speaker>
<line>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</line>
<line>Why this same strict and most observant watch</line>
<line>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</line>
<line>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</line>
<line>And foreign mart for implements of war;</line>
<line>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</line>
<line>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</line>
<line>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</line>
<line>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</line>
<line>Who is't that can inform me?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HORATIO</speaker>
<line>That can I;</line>
<line>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</line>
<line>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</line>
<line>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</line>
<line>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</line>
<line>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--</line>
<line>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--</line>
<line>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</line>
<line>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</line>
<line>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</line>
<line>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</line>
<line>Against the which, a moiety competent</line>
<line>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</line>
<line>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</line>
<line>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</line>
<line>And carriage of the article design'd,</line>
<line>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</line>
<line>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</line>
<line>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</line>
<line>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</line>
<line>For food and diet, to some enterprise</line>
<line>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--</line>
<line>As it doth well appear unto our state--</line>
<line>But to recover of us, by strong hand</line>
<line>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</line>
<line>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</line>
<line>Is the main motive of our preparations,</line>
<line>The source of this our watch and the chief head</line>
<line>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BERNARDO</speaker>
<line>I think it be no other but e'en so:</line>

<line>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</line>
<line>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</line>
<line>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</line>
<line>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</line>
<line>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</line>
<line>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</line>
<line>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</line>
<line>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</line>
<line>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</line>
<line>As harbingers preceding still the fates</line>
<line>And prologue to the omen coming on,</line>

<line>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HORATIO</speaker>
<line>And then it started like a guilty thing</line>
<line>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</line>
<line>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</line>
<line>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</line>
<line>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</line>
<line>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</line>
<line>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</line>
<line>To his confine: and of the truth herein</line>
<line>This present object made probation.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">MARCELLUS</speaker>
<line>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</line>
<line>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</line>
<line>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</line>
<line>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</line>
<line>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</line>
<line>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</line>
<line>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</line>
<line>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HORATIO</speaker>
<line>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</line>
<line>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</line>
<line>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</line>
<line>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</line>
<line>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</line>
<line>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</line>
<line>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</line>
<line>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</line>
<line>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</line>

<line>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</line>

<line>Why should we in our peevish opposition</line>

<line>Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</line>
<line>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</line>
<line>Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,</line>
<line>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,</line>
<line>Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</line>
<line>You must not take for fire. From this time</line>
<line>Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;</line>
<line>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</line>
<line>Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</line>
<line>Believe so much in him, that he is young</line>
<line>And with a larger tether may he walk</line>
<line>Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</line>
<line>Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,</line>
<line>Not of that dye which their investments show,</line>
<line>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</line>
<line>Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,</line>
<line>The better to beguile. This is for all:</line>
<line>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,</line>
<line>Have you so slander any moment leisure,</line>

<line>Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.</line>

<line>From our achievements, though perform'd at height,</line>
<line>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</line>

<line>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</line>
<line>Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--</line>
<line>Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,</line>

<line>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was</line>

<line>caviare to the general: but it was--as I received</line>

<line>cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well</line>
<line>digested in the scenes, set down with as much</line>
<line>modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there</line>
<line>were no sallets in the lines to make the matter</line>
<line>savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might</line>
<line>indict the author of affectation; but called it an</line>
<line>honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very</line>
<line>much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I</line>
<line>chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and</line>
<line>thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of</line>
<line>Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin</line>
<line>at this line: let me see, let me see--</line>
<line>'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--</line>
<line>it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--</line>
<line>'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</line>
<line>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</line>
<line>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</line>
<line>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd</line>
<line>With heraldry more dismal; head to foot</line>
<line>Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd</line>
<line>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</line>
<line>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</line>
<line>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</line>

<line>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,</line>
<line>Which was declining on the milky head</line>
<line>Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:</line>
<line>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</line>

<line>Look here, upon this picture, and on this,</line>
<line>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</line>
<line>See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</line>
<line>Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;</line>
<line>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</line>
<line>A station like the herald Mercury</line>
<line>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</line>
<line>A combination and a form indeed,</line>
<line>Where every god did seem to set his seal,</line>
<line>To give the world assurance of a man:</line>
<line>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:</line>
<line>Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,</line>
<line>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</line>
<line>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</line>
<line>And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?</line>
<line>You cannot call it love; for at your age</line>
<line>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,</line>
<line>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</line>
<line>Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,</line>
<line>Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</line>
<line>Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,</line>
<line>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd</line>
<line>But it reserved some quantity of choice,</line>
<line>To serve in such a difference. What devil was't</line>
<line>That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?</line>
<line>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</line>
<line>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</line>
<line>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</line>
<line>Could not so mope.</line>
<line>O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</line>
<line>If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,</line>
<line>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,</line>
