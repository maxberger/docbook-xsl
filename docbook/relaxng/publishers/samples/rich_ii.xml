<line>First, heaven be the record to my speech!</line>

<line>Tendering the precious safety of my prince,</line>

<line>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</line>
<line>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</line>
<line>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</line>
<line>My body shall make good upon this earth,</line>
<line>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</line>
<line>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</line>
<line>Too good to be so and too bad to live,</line>
<line>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</line>
<line>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</line>
<line>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</line>
<line>With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;</line>
<line>And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,</line>
<line>What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<line>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:</line>
<line>'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,</line>
<line>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</line>
<line>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</line>
<line>The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:</line>
<line>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</line>
<line>As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:</line>
<line>First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me</line>
<line>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;</line>
<line>Which else would post until it had return'd</line>
<line>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</line>
<line>Setting aside his high blood's royalty,</line>
<line>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</line>
<line>I do defy him, and I spit at him;</line>
<line>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:</line>
<line>Which to maintain I would allow him odds,</line>
<line>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</line>
<line>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</line>
<line>Or any other ground inhabitable,</line>
<line>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</line>
<line>Mean time let this defend my loyalty,</line>
<line>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<line>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</line>
<line>Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,</line>
<line>And lay aside my high blood's royalty,</line>
<line>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</line>
<line>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</line>
<line>As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:</line>
<line>By that and all the rites of knighthood else,</line>

<speaker role="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<line>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;</line>
<line>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</line>
<line>In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,</line>
<line>The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,</line>
<line>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</line>
<line>Besides I say and will in battle prove,</line>
<line>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</line>
<line>That ever was survey'd by English eye,</line>
<line>That all the treasons for these eighteen years</line>
<line>Complotted and contrived in this land</line>
<line>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</line>
<line>Further I say and further will maintain</line>
<line>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</line>
<line>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,</line>
<line>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</line>
<line>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</line>
<line>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</line>
<line>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,</line>
<line>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</line>
<line>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</line>
<line>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</line>
<line>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</line>

<line>Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?</line>

<line>O, let my sovereign turn away his face</line>

<line>Till I have told this slander of his blood,</line>
<line>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<line>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:</line>
<line>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,</line>
<line>As he is but my father's brother's son,</line>
<line>Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,</line>
<line>Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood</line>
<line>Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize</line>
<line>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:</line>
<line>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:</line>
<line>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<line>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</line>
<line>Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</line>
<line>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</line>
<line>Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;</line>
<line>The other part reserved I by consent,</line>
<line>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</line>
<line>Upon remainder of a dear account,</line>
<line>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</line>
<line>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,</line>
<line>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace</line>
<line>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</line>
<line>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</line>
<line>The honourable father to my foe</line>
<line>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</line>
<line>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul</line>
<line>But ere I last received the sacrament</line>
<line>I did confess it, and exactly begg'd</line>
<line>Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.</line>
<line>This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,</line>
<line>It issues from the rancour of a villain,</line>
<line>A recreant and most degenerate traitor</line>
<line>Which in myself I boldly will defend;</line>
<line>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</line>
<line>Upon this overweening traitor's foot,</line>
<line>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</line>
<line>Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.</line>
<line>In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</line>
<line>Your highness to assign our trial day.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<line>I have been studying how I may compare</line>
<line>This prison where I live unto the world:</line>
<line>And for because the world is populous</line>
<line>And here is not a creature but myself,</line>
<line>I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.</line>
<line>My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,</line>
<line>My soul the father; and these two beget</line>
<line>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</line>
<line>And these same thoughts people this little world,</line>
<line>In humours like the people of this world,</line>
<line>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</line>
<line>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd</line>
<line>With scruples and do set the word itself</line>
<line>Against the word:</line>
<line>As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,</line>
<line>'It is as hard to come as for a camel</line>
<line>To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'</line>
<line>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</line>
<line>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</line>
<line>May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</line>
<line>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</line>
<line>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</line>
<line>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</line>
<line>That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,</line>
<line>Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</line>
<line>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</line>
<line>That many have and others must sit there;</line>
<line>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</line>
<line>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</line>
<line>Of such as have before endured the like.</line>
<line>Thus play I in one person many people,</line>
<line>And none contented: sometimes am I king;</line>
<line>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</line>
<line>And so I am: then crushing penury</line>
<line>Persuades me I was better when a king;</line>
<line>Then am I king'd again: and by and by</line>
<line>Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,</line>
<line>And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,</line>
<line>Nor I nor any man that but man is</line>
<line>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</line>
<line>With being nothing. Music do I hear?</line>
<para role="stagedir">Music</para>
<line>Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,</line>

<line>To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;</line>
<line>But for the concord of my state and time</line>
<line>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</line>
<line>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</line>
<line>For now hath time made me his numbering clock:</line>
<line>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</line>
<line>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</line>
<line>Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</line>
<line>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</line>
<line>Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</line>
<line>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</line>
<line>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</line>
<line>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</line>
<line>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</line>
<line>While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.</line>
<line>This music mads me; let it sound no more;</line>
<line>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</line>
<line>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</line>
<line>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</line>
