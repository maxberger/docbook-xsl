<line>You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom</line>
<line>He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow</line>
<line>That late he married--hath referr'd herself</line>
<line>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;</line>
<line>Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all</line>
<line>Is outward sorrow; though I think the king</line>
<line>Be touch'd at very heart.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Second Gentleman</speaker>
<line>None but the king?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,</line>
<line>That most desired the match; but not a courtier,</line>
<line>Although they wear their faces to the bent</line>
<line>Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not</line>
<line>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Second Gentleman</speaker>
<line>And why so?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing</line>
<line>Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--</line>
<line>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</line>
<line>And therefore banish'd--is a creature such</line>
<line>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</line>
<line>For one his like, there would be something failing</line>
<line>In him that should compare. I do not think</line>
<line>So fair an outward and such stuff within</line>
<line>Endows a man but he.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Second Gentleman</speaker>
<line>You speak him far.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</line>
<line>Crush him together rather than unfold</line>
<line>His measure duly.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Second Gentleman</speaker>
<line>What's his name and birth?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</line>
<line>Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour</line>
<line>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</line>
<line>But had his titles by Tenantius whom</line>
<line>He served with glory and admired success,</line>
<line>So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;</line>
<line>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</line>
<line>Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time</line>
<line>Died with their swords in hand; for which</line>
<line>their father,</line>
<line>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</line>
<line>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</line>
<line>Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased</line>
<line>As he was born. The king he takes the babe</line>
<line>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</line>
<line>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,</line>
<line>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</line>
<line>Could make him the receiver of; which he took,</line>
<line>As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,</line>
<line>And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--</line>
<line>Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,</line>
<line>A sample to the youngest, to the more mature</line>
<line>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</line>
<line>A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,</line>
<line>For whom he now is banish'd, her own price</line>
<line>Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;</line>
<line>By her election may be truly read</line>
<line>What kind of man he is.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Second Gentleman</speaker>
<line>I honour him</line>
<line>Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,</line>
<line>Is she sole child to the king?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">First Gentleman</speaker>
<line>His only child.</line>
<line>He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,</line>
<line>Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,</line>
<line>I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery</line>
<line>Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</line>
<line>Which way they went.</line>

<line>With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,</line>
