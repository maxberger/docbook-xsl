<line>Boundless intemperance</line>
<line>In nature is a tyranny; it hath been</line>
<line>The untimely emptying of the happy throne</line>

<line>Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</line>
<line>And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.</line>
<line>We have willing dames enough: there cannot be</line>

<line>Desire his jewels and this other's house:</line>

<line>We shall not spend a large expense of time</line>
<line>Before we reckon with your several loves,</line>
<line>And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,</line>
<line>Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland</line>
<line>In such an honour named. What's more to do,</line>
<line>Which would be planted newly with the time,</line>
<line>As calling home our exiled friends abroad</line>
<line>That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;</line>
<line>Producing forth the cruel ministers</line>
<line>Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,</line>
<line>Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands</line>
<line>Took off her life; this, and what needful else</line>
<line>That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,</line>
<line>We will perform in measure, time and place:</line>
<line>So, thanks to all at once and to each one,</line>
<line>Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.</line>
