<line>The brightest heaven of invention,</line>
<line>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act</line>
<line>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</line>
<line>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</line>

<line>The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</line>

<line>O, pardon! since a crooked figure may</line>

<line>Suppose within the girdle of these walls</line>

<line>And make imaginary puissance;</line>
<line>Think when we talk of horses, that you see them</line>
<line>Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;</line>
<line>For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</line>
<line>Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,</line>
<line>Turning the accomplishment of many years</line>
<line>Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,</line>

<line>My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,</line>

<line>Would they strip from us; being valued thus:</line>

<line>The courses of his youth promised it not.</line>
<line>The breath no sooner left his father's body,</line>

<line>Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment</line>
<line>Consideration, like an angel, came</line>
<line>And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,</line>
<line>Leaving his body as a paradise,</line>
<line>To envelop and contain celestial spirits.</line>
<line>Never was such a sudden scholar made;</line>
<line>Never came reformation in a flood,</line>
<line>With such a heady currance, scouring faults</line>
<line>Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness</line>
<line>So soon did lose his seat and all at once</line>

<line>Hear him but reason in divinity,</line>
<line>And all-admiring with an inward wish</line>
<line>You would desire the king were made a prelate:</line>
<line>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</line>
<line>You would say it hath been all in all his study:</line>
<line>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</line>
<line>A fearful battle render'd you in music:</line>
<line>Turn him to any cause of policy,</line>
<line>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</line>
<line>Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,</line>
<line>The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,</line>
<line>And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,</line>
<line>To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;</line>
<line>So that the art and practic part of life</line>
<line>Must be the mistress to this theoric:</line>
<line>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</line>
<line>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</line>
<line>His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,</line>
<line>His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,</line>
<line>And never noted in him any study,</line>
<line>Any retirement, any sequestration</line>
<line>From open haunts and popularity.</line>

<line>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle</line>
<line>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</line>
<line>Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:</line>
<line>And so the prince obscured his contemplation</line>
<line>Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,</line>
<line>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</line>
<line>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CANTERBURY</speaker>
<line>It must be so; for miracles are ceased;</line>

<line>But, my good lord,</line>
<line>How now for mitigation of this bill</line>

<line>Incline to it, or no?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CANTERBURY</speaker>
<line>He seems indifferent,</line>
<line>Or rather swaying more upon our part</line>
<line>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;</line>
<line>For I have made an offer to his majesty,</line>
<line>Upon our spiritual convocation</line>
<line>And in regard of causes now in hand,</line>
<line>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,</line>
<line>As touching France, to give a greater sum</line>

<line>Did to his predecessors part withal.</line>

<line>With good acceptance of his majesty;</line>
<line>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</line>
<line>As I perceived his grace would fain have done,</line>
<line>The severals and unhidden passages</line>
<line>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms</line>
<line>And generally to the crown and seat of France</line>
<line>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>Sure, we thank you.</line>
<line>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed</line>
<line>And justly and religiously unfold</line>
<line>Why the law Salique that they have in France</line>
<line>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:</line>
<line>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</line>
<line>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</line>
<line>Or nicely charge your understanding soul</line>
<line>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</line>
<line>Suits not in native colours with the truth;</line>
<line>For God doth know how many now in health</line>
<line>Shall drop their blood in approbation</line>
<line>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</line>
<line>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</line>
<line>How you awake our sleeping sword of war:</line>
<line>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;</line>
<line>For never two such kingdoms did contend</line>
<line>Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops</line>
<line>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint</line>
<line>'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords</line>
<line>That make such waste in brief mortality.</line>
<line>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;</line>
<line>For we will hear, note and believe in heart</line>
<line>That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd</line>
<line>As pure as sin with baptism.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CANTERBURY</speaker>
<line>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</line>
<line>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</line>
<line>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</line>
<line>To make against your highness' claim to France</line>
<line>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</line>
<line>'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</line>
<line>'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</line>
<line>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</line>
<line>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</line>
<line>The founder of this law and female bar.</line>
<line>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</line>
<line>That the land Salique is in Germany,</line>
<line>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</line>
<line>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</line>
<line>There left behind and settled certain French;</line>
<line>Who, holding in disdain the German women</line>
<line>For some dishonest manners of their life,</line>
<line>Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</line>
<line>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</line>
<line>Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</line>
<line>Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</line>
<line>Then doth it well appear that Salique law</line>
<line>Was not devised for the realm of France:</line>
<line>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</line>
<line>Until four hundred one and twenty years</line>
<line>After defunction of King Pharamond,</line>
<line>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</line>
<line>Who died within the year of our redemption</line>
<line>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</line>
<line>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</line>
<line>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</line>
<line>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</line>
<line>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</line>
<line>Did, as heir general, being descended</line>
<line>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</line>
<line>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</line>
<line>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</line>
<line>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</line>
<line>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</line>
<line>To find his title with some shows of truth,</line>
<line>'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</line>
<line>Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</line>
<line>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</line>
<line>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</line>
<line>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</line>
<line>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</line>
<line>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</line>
<line>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</line>
<line>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</line>
<line>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</line>
<line>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</line>
<line>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</line>
<line>Was re-united to the crown of France.</line>
<line>So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</line>
<line>King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</line>
<line>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</line>
<line>To hold in right and title of the female:</line>
<line>So do the kings of France unto this day;</line>
<line>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</line>
<line>To bar your highness claiming from the female,</line>
<line>And rather choose to hide them in a net</line>
<line>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</line>
<line>Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.</line>

<line>Making defeat on the full power of France,</line>
<line>Whiles his most mighty father on a hill</line>
<line>Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp</line>
<line>Forage in blood of French nobility.</line>

<line>We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,</line>
<line>But fear the main intendment of the Scot,</line>
<line>Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;</line>
<line>For you shall read that my great-grandfather</line>
<line>Never went with his forces into France</line>
<line>But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom</line>
<line>Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,</line>
<line>With ample and brim fulness of his force,</line>
<line>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,</line>
<line>Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;</line>
<line>That England, being empty of defence,</line>
<line>Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CANTERBURY</speaker>
<line>She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;</line>
<line>For hear her but exampled by herself:</line>
<line>When all her chivalry hath been in France</line>
<line>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</line>
<line>She hath herself not only well defended</line>
<line>But taken and impounded as a stray</line>
<line>The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,</line>
<line>To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings</line>
<line>And make her chronicle as rich with praise</line>
<line>As is the ooze and bottom of the sea</line>
<line>With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<line>But there's a saying very old and true,</line>
<line>'If that you will France win,</line>
<line>Then with Scotland first begin:'</line>
<line>For once the eagle England being in prey,</line>
<line>To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot</line>
<line>Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,</line>
<line>Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,</line>
<line>To tear and havoc more than she can eat.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">EXETER</speaker>
<line>It follows then the cat must stay at home:</line>
<line>Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,</line>
<line>Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,</line>
<line>And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.</line>
<line>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</line>
<line>The advised head defends itself at home;</line>

<line>As young as I am, I have observed these three</line>

<line>three, though they would serve me, could not be man</line>
<line>to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to</line>
<line>a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and</line>
<line>red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</line>
<line>fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</line>
<line>and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</line>
<line>words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</line>
<line>heard that men of few words are the best men; and</line>
<line>therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</line>
<line>should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</line>
<line>are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</line>
<line>broke any man's head but his own, and that was</line>
<line>against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</line>
<line>any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</line>
<line>lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</line>
<line>three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</line>
<line>brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</line>
<line>fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</line>
<line>men would carry coals. They would have me as</line>
<line>familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</line>
<line>handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</line>
<line>if I should take from another's pocket to put into</line>
<line>mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I</line>
<line>must leave them, and seek some better service:</line>

<speaker role="speaker">WILLIAMS</speaker>
<line>Under what captain serve you?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WILLIAMS</speaker>
<line>A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I</line>
<line>pray you, what thinks he of our estate?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be</line>
<line>washed off the next tide.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BATES</speaker>
<line>He hath not told his thought to the king?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I</line>
<line>speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I</line>
<line>am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the</line>
<line>element shows to him as it doth to me; all his</line>
<line>senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies</line>
<line>laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and</line>
<line>though his affections are higher mounted than ours,</line>
<line>yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like</line>
<line>wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we</line>
<line>do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish</line>
<line>as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess</line>
<line>him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing</line>
<line>it, should dishearten his army.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BATES</speaker>
<line>He may show what outward courage he will; but I</line>
<line>believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish</line>
<line>himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he</line>
<line>were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:</line>
<line>I think he would not wish himself any where but</line>
<line>where he is.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BATES</speaker>
<line>Then I would he were here alone; so should he be</line>
<line>sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here</line>
<line>alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's</line>
<line>minds: methinks I could not die any where so</line>
<line>contented as in the king's company; his cause being</line>
<line>just and his quarrel honourable.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WILLIAMS</speaker>
<line>That's more than we know.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BATES</speaker>
<line>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know</line>
<line>enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if</line>
<line>his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes</line>
<line>the crime of it out of us.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WILLIAMS</speaker>
<line>But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath</line>
<line>a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and</line>
<line>arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join</line>
<line>together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at</line>
<line>such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a</line>
<line>surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind</line>
<line>them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their</line>
<line>children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die</line>
<line>well that die in a battle; for how can they</line>
<line>charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their</line>
<line>argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it</line>
<line>will be a black matter for the king that led them to</line>
<line>it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of</line>
<line>subjection.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>So, if a son that is by his father sent about</line>
<line>merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the</line>
<line>imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be</line>
<line>imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a</line>
<line>servant, under his master's command transporting a</line>
<line>sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in</line>
<line>many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</line>
<line>business of the master the author of the servant's</line>
<line>damnation: but this is not so: the king is not</line>
<line>bound to answer the particular endings of his</line>
<line>soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</line>
<line>his servant; for they purpose not their death, when</line>
<line>they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</line>
<line>king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</line>
<line>the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</line>
<line>unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</line>
<line>the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;</line>
<line>some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</line>
<line>perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that</line>
<line>have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with</line>
<line>pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have</line>
<line>defeated the law and outrun native punishment,</line>
<line>though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</line>
<line>fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;</line>
<line>so that here men are punished for before-breach of</line>
<line>the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</line>
<line>they feared the death, they have borne life away;</line>
<line>and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</line>
<line>they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</line>
<line>their damnation than he was before guilty of those</line>
<line>impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</line>
<line>subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's</line>
<line>soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</line>
<line>the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</line>
<line>mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</line>
<line>is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was</line>
<line>blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:</line>
<line>and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think</line>
<line>that, making God so free an offer, He let him</line>
<line>outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach</line>
<line>others how they should prepare.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WILLIAMS</speaker>
<line>'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon</line>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<speaker role="speaker">WILLIAMS</speaker>
<line>Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but</line>

<line>do against a monarch! you may as well go about to</line>

<line>He that shall live this day, and see old age,</line>
<line>Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,</line>
<line>And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'</line>
<line>Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.</line>
<line>And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'</line>
<line>Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,</line>
<line>But he'll remember with advantages</line>
<line>What feats he did that day: then shall our names.</line>
<line>Familiar in his mouth as household words</line>
<line>Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,</line>
<line>Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,</line>
<line>Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.</line>
<line>This story shall the good man teach his son;</line>
<line>And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,</line>
<line>From this day to the ending of the world,</line>
<line>But we in it shall be remember'd;</line>
<line>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</line>
<line>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</line>
<line>Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,</line>
<line>This day shall gentle his condition:</line>
<line>And gentlemen in England now a-bed</line>
<line>Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,</line>

<line>thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king</line>
<line>that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my</line>
<line>crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but</line>
<line>directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me</line>
<line>farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY V</speaker>
<line>Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for</line>
<line>your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I</line>
<line>have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I</line>
<line>have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable</line>
<line>measure in strength. If I could win a lady at</line>
<line>leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my</line>
<line>armour on my back, under the correction of bragging</line>
<line>be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.</line>
<line>Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse</line>
<line>for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and</line>
<line>sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,</line>
<line>Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my</line>
<line>eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;</line>
<line>only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,</line>
<line>nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a</line>
<line>fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth</line>
<line>sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love</line>
<line>of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy</line>
<line>cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst</line>
<line>love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee</line>
<line>that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the</line>
<line>Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou</line>
<line>livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and</line>
<line>uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee</line>
<line>right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other</line>
<line>places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that</line>
<line>can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</line>
<line>always reason themselves out again. What! a</line>
<line>speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A</line>
<line>good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a</line>
<line>black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow</line>
<line>bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax</line>
<line>hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the</line>
<line>moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it</line>
<line>shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</line>
<line>course truly. If thou would have such a one, take</line>
<line>me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,</line>
<line>take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?</line>
<line>speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</line>

<line>the friend of France; for I love France so well that</line>
<line>I will not part with a village of it; I will have it</line>

<line>Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:</line>
<line>my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of</line>
<line>beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou</line>
<line>hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou</line>
<line>shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:</line>
<line>and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you</line>
<line>have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the</line>
<line>thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;</line>
<line>take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am</line>
<line>thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine</line>
<line>ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is</line>
<line>thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry</line>
<line>Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before</line>
<line>his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,</line>
<line>thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.</line>
<line>Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is</line>
<line>music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of</line>
<line>all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken</line>
<line>English; wilt thou have me?</line>

<line>Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you</line>
