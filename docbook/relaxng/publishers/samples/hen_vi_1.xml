<line>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</line>

<line>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</line>
<line>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,</line>
<line>I must inform you of a dismal fight</line>
<line>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<line>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:</line>
<line>The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</line>
<line>The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</line>
<line>Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</line>
<line>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</line>
<line>By three and twenty thousand of the French</line>
<line>Was round encompassed and set upon.</line>
<line>No leisure had he to enrank his men;</line>
<line>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</line>
<line>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</line>
<line>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</line>
<line>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</line>
<line>More than three hours the fight continued;</line>
<line>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</line>
<line>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</line>
<line>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</line>
<line>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</line>
<line>The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;</line>
<line>All the whole army stood agazed on him:</line>
<line>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</line>
<line>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</line>
<line>And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</line>
<line>Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,</line>
<line>If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:</line>
<line>He, being in the vaward, placed behind</line>
<line>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</line>
<line>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</line>
<line>Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</line>
<line>Enclosed were they with their enemies:</line>
<line>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</line>
<line>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</line>
<line>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</line>
<line>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEDFORD</speaker>
<line>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,</line>
<line>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</line>
<line>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</line>
<line>Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,</line>
<line>And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:</line>
<line>Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BEDFORD</speaker>
<line>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</line>
<line>I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:</line>
<line>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</line>
<line>Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.</line>
<line>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;</line>
<line>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</line>
<line>To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:</line>
<line>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</line>
<line>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">Messenger</speaker>
<line>So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;</line>
<line>The English army is grown weak and faint:</line>

<line>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</line>
<line>As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</line>
<line>Marriage is a matter of more worth</line>
<line>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;</line>
<line>Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,</line>
<line>Must be companion of his nuptial bed:</line>
<line>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</line>
<line>It most of all these reasons bindeth us,</line>
<line>In our opinions she should be preferr'd.</line>
<line>For what is wedlock forced but a hell,</line>
<line>An age of discord and continual strife?</line>
<line>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</line>
<line>And is a pattern of celestial peace.</line>
<line>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</line>
<line>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</line>
<line>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</line>
<line>Approves her fit for none but for a king:</line>
<line>Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</line>
<line>More than in women commonly is seen,</line>
<line>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</line>
<line>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</line>
<line>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</line>
<line>If with a lady of so high resolve</line>
<line>As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.</line>
<line>Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me</line>
<line>That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.</line>

<line>Whether it be through force of your report,</line>
<line>My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</line>
<line>My tender youth was never yet attaint</line>
<line>With any passion of inflaming love,</line>
<line>I cannot tell; but this I am assured,</line>
<line>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</line>
<line>Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</line>
<line>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</line>
<line>Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;</line>
<line>Agree to any covenants, and procure</line>
<line>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</line>
<line>To cross the seas to England and be crown'd</line>
<line>King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:</line>
<line>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</line>
<line>Among the people gather up a tenth.</line>
<line>Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,</line>
<line>I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</line>
<line>And you, good uncle, banish all offence:</line>
<line>If you do censure me by what you were,</line>
<line>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</line>
<line>This sudden execution of my will.</line>
<line>And so, conduct me where, from company,</line>
<line>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</line>
