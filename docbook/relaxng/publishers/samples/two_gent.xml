<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:</line>
<line>Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.</line>
<line>Were't not affection chains thy tender days</line>
<line>To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,</line>
<line>I rather would entreat thy company</line>
<line>To see the wonders of the world abroad,</line>
<line>Than, living dully sluggardized at home,</line>
<line>Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</line>
<line>But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,</line>
<line>Even as I would when I to love begin.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!</line>
<line>Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest</line>
<line>Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:</line>
<line>Wish me partaker in thy happiness</line>
<line>When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,</line>
<line>If ever danger do environ thee,</line>
<line>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</line>
<line>For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>And on a love-book pray for my success?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>That's on some shallow story of deep love:</line>
<line>How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>That's a deep story of a deeper love:</line>
<line>For he was more than over shoes in love.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,</line>
<line>And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>What?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;</line>
<line>Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth</line>
<line>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:</line>
<line>If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;</line>
<line>If lost, why then a grievous labour won;</line>
<line>However, but a folly bought with wit,</line>
<line>Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>Love is your master, for he masters you:</line>
<line>And he that is so yoked by a fool,</line>
<line>Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud</line>
<line>The eating canker dwells, so eating love</line>
<line>Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>And writers say, as the most forward bud</line>
<line>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</line>
<line>Even so by love the young and tender wit</line>
<line>Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,</line>
<line>Losing his verdure even in the prime</line>
<line>And all the fair effects of future hopes.</line>
<line>But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,</line>
<line>That art a votary to fond desire?</line>
<line>Once more adieu! my father at the road</line>
<line>Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">VALENTINE</speaker>
<line>Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.</line>
<line>To Milan let me hear from thee by letters</line>
<line>Of thy success in love, and what news else</line>
<line>Betideth here in absence of thy friend;</line>
<line>And likewise will visit thee with mine.</line>

<line>Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,</line>
<line>An if the shepherd be a while away.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>I do.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.</line>

<line>This proves me still a sheep.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the</line>
<line>shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks</line>
<line>not me: therefore I am no sheep.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the</line>
<line>shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for</line>
<line>wages followest thy master; thy master for wages</line>
<line>follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'</line>

<line>But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,</line>
<line>a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a</line>
<line>lost mutton, nothing for my labour.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.</line>

<line>Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for</line>
<line>carrying your letter.</line>

<line>You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,</line>
<line>'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to</line>
<line>your lover.</line>

<line>Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask</line>
<line>me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>And that set together is noddy.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<line>Now you have taken the pains to set it together,</line>
<line>take it for your pains.</line>

<line>No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.</line>

<line>Why sir, how do you bear with me?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing</line>
<line>but the word 'noddy' for my pains.</line>

<line>Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</line>

<line>And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</line>

<line>Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>Open your purse, that the money and the matter may</line>

<line>Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?</line>

<line>Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.</line>

<line>Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,</line>
<line>not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:</line>
<line>and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I</line>
<line>fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your</line>
<line>mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as</line>
<line>hard as steel.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>What said she? nothing?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">SPEED</speaker>
<line>No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To</line>
<line>testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned</line>
<line>me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your</line>
<line>letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.</line>

<line>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</line>

<line>I know you have determined to bestow her</line>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUKE</speaker>
<line>Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>Ay, if his enemy deliver it:</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUKE</speaker>

<line>Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUKE</speaker>
<line>And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,</line>

<speaker role="speaker">PROTEUS</speaker>
<line>As much as I can do, I will effect:</line>

<line>Say that upon the altar of her beauty</line>
<line>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:</line>
<line>Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</line>
<line>Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</line>
<line>That may discover such integrity:</line>
<line>For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,</line>
<line>Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</line>
<line>Make tigers tame and huge leviathans</line>
<line>Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</line>
<line>After your dire-lamenting elegies,</line>
<line>Visit by night your lady's chamber-window</line>
<line>With some sweet concert; to their instruments</line>

<line>When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,</line>
<line>look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a</line>
<line>puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or</line>
<line>four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.</line>
<line>I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,</line>
<line>'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver</line>
<line>him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;</line>
<line>and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he</line>
<line>steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:</line>
<line>O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself</line>
<line>in all companies! I would have, as one should say,</line>
<line>one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,</line>
<line>as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had</line>
<line>more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,</line>
<line>I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I</line>
<line>live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He</line>
<line>thrusts me himself into the company of three or four</line>
<line>gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had</line>
<line>not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but</line>
<line>all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says</line>
<line>one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him</line>
<line>out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.</line>
<line>I, having been acquainted with the smell before,</line>
<line>knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that</line>
<line>whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip</line>
<line>the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him</line>
<line>the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you</line>
<line>wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out</line>
<line>of the chamber. How many masters would do this for</line>
<line>his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the</line>
<line>stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had</line>
<line>been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese</line>
<line>he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.</line>
<line>Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the</line>
<line>trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam</line>
<line>Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I</line>
