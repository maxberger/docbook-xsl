This directory contains slides.dsl stylesheet which can be used for
rendering DocBook Slides. It outputs one slide to one page and you can
use auxiliary tools or print drivers to get 2up or 4up page
arrangements. I use this stylesheet to print slides for my
students. Stylesheet is not perfect, but it does amount of usable work.

Typical usage is:

jade -d slides.dsl -t rtf /path/to/xml.dcl your-slides.xml

If you get following error message from Jade:

jade.exe:slides.dsl:2:96:W: cannot generate system identifier for public text "-//Norman Walsh//DOCUMENT DocBook Print Stylesheet//EN"

you must add entry for DSSSL print stylesheet to your catalog file, or
change second line of slides.dsl from PUBLIC to SYSTEM identifier and
replace FPI with path to your local copy of print stylesheet.

Enjoy it!
