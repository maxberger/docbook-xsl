    can be a publisher these days. Now you can reach a world-wide audience by putting a few
    HTML pages up on your website. Or you can use desktop publishing software to produce
    beautifully typeset material that can be printed on demand or downloaded to a printer
    anywhere in the world. With DocBook, you can publish both ways from the same source
    material.</para></topic>
