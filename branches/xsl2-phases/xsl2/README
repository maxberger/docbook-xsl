              README file for the DocBook XSL2 Stylesheets
----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Id$

These are XSL stylesheets -- currently, EXPERIMENTAL and
INCOMPLETE ones -- for transforming DocBook XML document instances
into various output formats (well, actually, currently HTML and FO
output only). They require use of an XSLT engine that supports the
XSLT 2.0 standard (which currently means they require Saxon 8).

Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
See the INSTALL file for information about installing this release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use the stylesheets
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The base canonical URI for these stylesheets is:

  http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl2/current/

You call any of the stylesheets in this distribution by doing one
of the following:

  - Use the base canonical URI in combination with one of the
    pathnames below. For example, for "chunked" HTML, output:

    http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl2/current/html/chunk.xsl

    If your system has a working XML Catalog or SGML Catalog setup
    (most Linux systems do), then that URI will automatically be
    resolved and replaced with a local pathname on your system.

  - Use a "real" local system base path in combination with one of
    the pathnames below. For example, for "chunked" HTML, output:

    /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/dbk/xsl2/html/chunk.xsl

To transform documents created with the standard DocBook schema/DTD
(or DocBook NG schema/DTD, use one of the following stylesheets:

  html/docbook.xsl        - for HTML (as a single file)
  html/chunk.xsl          - for HTML (chunked into multiple files)
  fo/docbook.xsl          - for XSL-FO
