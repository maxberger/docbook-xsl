DocBook is a <ulink url="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#doctype">Document Type
Definition</ulink> (DTD) maintained by the <ulink
url="mailto:docbook-tc@oasis-open.org">DocBook Technical
Committee</ulink> of <ulink
url="http://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</ulink>. It is particularly
well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software
(though it is by no means limited to these applications).

Because it is a large and robust DTD, and because its main
structures correspond to the general notion of what constitutes
a <quote>book</quote>, DocBook has been adopted by a large and
growing community of authors writing documents of all kinds. DocBook
is supported <quote>out of the box</quote> by a number of
commercial tools, and there is rapidly expanding support for it
in a number of free software environments. These features have
combined to make DocBook a generally easy to understand, widely
useful, and very popular DTD. Dozens of organizations are using
DocBook for millions of pages of documentation, in various print
and online formats, worldwide.
