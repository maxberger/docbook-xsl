DTD Installation
----------------

Place the files in this distribution somewhere on your machine.  Adjust
your catalog(s) if appropriate (XML tools frequently do not support 
catalogs, so this may be irrelevant for you).

Please use the following formal public identifier to identify this DTD:

  "-//Norman Walsh//DTD Website V1.10//EN"

For example:

  <!DOCTYPE website PUBLIC "-//Norman Walsh//DTD Website V1.10//EN"
                    "http://docbook.sourceforge.net/repository/website/1.10/website.dtd" [
  ...
  ]>

XSL Installation
----------------

Place the XSL files in this distribution somewhere on your machine.

Use
---

Process your Website documents with one of the following stylesheets
using your favorite XSLT processor:

  website.xsl   produces a flat-text website
  tabular.xsl   produces a tabular website with navigation in the
                left-hand column and page contents in the right-hand
                column.

    Both of these stylesheets produce a monolithic file that must be
    chunked. The chunk control files and libraries included in this
    distribution simplify this process, if you are using the chunk.pl
    file included in the DocBook XSL Stylesheet distribution.

  chunk-website.xsl produces a flat-text website, chunked by XSLT
  chunk-tabular.xsl produces a tabular website, chunked by XSLT

    In order for the chunking process to succeed, all necessary
    subdirectories must be created before you begin running the
    XSLT engine. The chunking versions support XT, Saxon, and Xalan.
