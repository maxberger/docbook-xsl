<para>This collection of pages is built from a single SGML
document using 
<ulink url="http://www.jclark.com/jade/">Jade</ulink> and a
customization of the DSSSL 
<ulink url="http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/">DocBook Stylesheet</ulink>
for HTML.</para>

<title>Why?</title>
<para>There are a number of compelling reasons to maintain these pages in
SGML rather than HTML.</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>First and foremost, they provide a test environment for the
HTML stylesheet.  Ok, maybe that's not compelling to you, but it's compelling
to me ;-).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Traditional printed documents are desirable for several of
these pages.</para>
<para>Using a more structurally rich format to represent the documents makes
it possible to produce print as well as online versions.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>All of the intra-document linking is automatic.</para>
<para>The SGML system provides validation for the inra-document links, so
there is no danger of broken links. (Links to external pages still have to
be validated by an external program.)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Migrating these pages to XML and/or future versions of HTML
will only require a new or updated style sheet. No pages will have to be recoded.
And the pages will conform to whatever output format is required, with no
possibility of random human error.</para>
