INSTALL file for the DocBook XSL Java extensions

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Case #1: Installation using a package management system
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you've installed the DocBook XSL Java distribution using
"apt-get", "yum", "urpmi", or some similar package-management
front-end, then, as part of the package installation, the
saxon65.jar and xalan27.jar files for the extensions have most
likely already been installed in the appropriate location for your
system. To determine where the jar files are installed, consult
the specific documentation for your system (for example, the
README.Debian file).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Case #2: Installing manually
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To manually "install" the saxon65.jar and xalan27.jar files, simply
place them in a directory where you'd normally store jar files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use the DocBook XSL Java extensions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the DocBook XSL Java extensions, add the absolute paths to
the saxon65.jar and xalan27.jar files (wherever you may have them
installed) to your Java classpath and process your documents with
either the Saxon or Xalan-Java XSLT engines and with the value of
the DocBook XSL stylesheets "use.extensions" parameter set to 1.

For a few more details, see the README file.
