INSTALL file for the DocBook Saxon extensions

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Case #1: Installation using a package management system
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you've installed the DocBook Saxon extensions distribution using
"apt-get", "yum", "urpmi", or some similar package-management
front-end, then as part of the package installation, the
saxon65.jar file for the extensions have most likely already been
installed in the appropriate location for your system. To determine
where the jar file is installed, consult the specific documentation
for your system (for example, the README.Debian file).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Case #2: Installing manually
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To manually "install" the saxon65.jar file, simply place it in a
directory where you'd normally store jar files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use the DocBook Saxon extensions

To use the DocBook Saxon extensions, add the absolute path to the
saxon65.jar file (wherever you may it installed) to your Java
classpath and process your documents with the Saxon XSLT engine and
with the value of the DocBook XSL stylesheets "use.extensions"
parameter set to 1.

For a few more details, see the README file.
