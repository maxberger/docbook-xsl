<line>To sing a song that old was sung,</line>

<line>It hath been sung at festivals,</line>

<line>This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great</line>
<line>Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:</line>
<line>The fairest in all Syria,</line>
<line>I tell you what mine authors say:</line>
<line>This king unto him took a fere,</line>
<line>Who died and left a female heir,</line>
<line>So buxom, blithe, and full of face,</line>
<line>As heaven had lent her all his grace;</line>
<line>With whom the father liking took,</line>
<line>And her to incest did provoke:</line>
<line>Bad child; worse father! to entice his own</line>
<line>To evil should be done by none:</line>
<line>But custom what they did begin</line>
<line>Was with long use account no sin.</line>
<line>The beauty of this sinful dame</line>
<line>Made many princes thither frame,</line>
<line>To seek her as a bed-fellow,</line>
<line>In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:</line>
<line>Which to prevent he made a law,</line>
<line>To keep her still, and men in awe,</line>
<line>That whoso ask'd her for his wife,</line>
<line>His riddle told not, lost his life:</line>
<line>So for her many a wight did die,</line>
<line>As yon grim looks do testify.</line>
<line>What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</line>
<line>I give, my cause who best can justify.</line>

<line>In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard</line>
<line>Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:</line>
<line>In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,</line>
<line>Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,</line>
<line>Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,</line>
<line>Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:</line>
<line>In Helicanus may you well descry</line>
<line>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:</line>
<line>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</line>
<line>The worth that learned charity aye wears:</line>
<line>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</line>
<line>Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name</line>
<line>Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,</line>
<line>That him and his they in his palace burn;</line>
<line>The gods for murder seemed so content</line>
<line>To punish them; although not done, but meant.</line>
<line>So, on your patience evermore attending,</line>
<line>New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</line>
