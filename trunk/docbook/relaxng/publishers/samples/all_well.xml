<line>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very</line>

<speaker role="speaker">COUNTESS</speaker>
<line>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</line>

<line>her education promises; her dispositions she</line>

<line>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</line>
<line>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HELENA</speaker>
<line>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</line>
<line>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how</line>
<line>may we barricado it against him?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAROLLES</speaker>
<line>Keep him out.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HELENA</speaker>
<line>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,</line>
<line>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</line>
<line>warlike resistance.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAROLLES</speaker>
<line>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</line>
<line>undermine you and blow you up.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HELENA</speaker>
<line>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</line>
<line>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</line>
<line>virgins might blow up men?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAROLLES</speaker>
<line>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</line>
<line>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</line>
<line>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</line>
<line>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</line>
<line>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</line>
<line>increase and there was never virgin got till</line>
<line>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</line>
<line>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</line>
<line>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is</line>
<line>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HELENA</speaker>
<line>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAROLLES</speaker>
<line>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the</line>
<line>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</line>
<line>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</line>
<line>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</line>
<line>virginity murders itself and should be buried in</line>
<line>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</line>
<line>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</line>
<line>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</line>
<line>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</line>
<line>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</line>
<line>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</line>
<line>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</line>
<line>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</line>
<line>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</line>
<line>principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HELENA</speaker>
<line>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PAROLLES</speaker>
<line>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it</line>
<line>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</line>
<line>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't</line>
<line>while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.</line>
<line>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</line>
<line>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</line>
<line>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</line>
<line>now. Your date is better in your pie and your</line>
<line>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,</line>
<line>your old virginity, is like one of our French</line>
<line>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,</line>
<line>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;</line>
<line>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">HELENA</speaker>
<line>Not my virginity yet</line>
<line>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</line>
<line>A mother and a mistress and a friend,</line>
<line>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</line>
<line>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</line>
<line>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</line>
<line>His humble ambition, proud humility,</line>
<line>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</line>
<line>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</line>

<line>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;</line>
<line>In these to nature she's immediate heir,</line>
<line>And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,</line>

<line>When rather from our acts we them derive</line>
<line>Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave</line>
<line>Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave</line>
<line>A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb</line>
<line>Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb</line>

<line>Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,</line>

<line>indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and</line>
<line>of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I</line>
<line>was in that credit with them at that time that I</line>
<line>knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,</line>
