<line>That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,</line>

<line>For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun</line>
<line>And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;</line>
<line>For all the accommodations that thou bear'st</line>
<line>Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;</line>
<line>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</line>
<line>Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</line>
<line>And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st</line>
<line>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</line>

<line>For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</line>
<line>Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,</line>
<line>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;</line>
<line>For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</line>
<line>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</line>
<line>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</line>
<line>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</line>
<line>But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,</line>
<line>Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth</line>
<line>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</line>
<line>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</line>
<line>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</line>
<line>To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this</line>

<line>She should this Angelo have married; was affianced</line>

<line>solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,</line>
<line>having in that perished vessel the dowry of his</line>
<line>sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the</line>
<line>poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and</line>
<line>renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most</line>
<line>kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of</line>

<speaker role="speaker">DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
<line>Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them</line>
<line>with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,</line>
<line>pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,</line>

<line>This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance</line>
<line>of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that</line>
<line>in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,</line>
<line>like an impediment in the current, made it more</line>
<line>violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his</line>
<line>requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with</line>
<line>his demands to the point; only refer yourself to</line>
<line>this advantage, first, that your stay with him may</line>
<line>not be long; that the time may have all shadow and</line>
<line>silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.</line>
<line>This being granted in course,--and now follows</line>
<line>all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up</line>
<line>your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter</line>
<line>acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to</line>
<line>her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother</line>
<line>saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana</line>
<line>advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid</line>
<line>will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you</line>

<line>would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days</line>
<line>entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if</line>

<line>boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.</line>
<line>Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is</line>
<line>no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath</line>

<line>Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was</line>
<line>the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his</line>
<line>death: you know the course is common. If any thing</line>

<line>Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see</line>

<line>persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go</line>
<line>further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.</line>
<line>Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the</line>

<line>The contents of this is the return of the duke: you</line>

<line>This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this</line>
<line>very day receives letters of strange tenor;</line>
<line>perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering</line>
<line>into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what</line>
<line>is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the</line>
<line>shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these</line>
<line>things should be: all difficulties are but easy</line>
<line>when they are known. Call your executioner, and off</line>
<line>with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present</line>
<line>shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you</line>
<line>are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.</line>
