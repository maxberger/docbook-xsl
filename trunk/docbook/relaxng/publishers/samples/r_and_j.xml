<line>Two households, both alike in dignity,</line>
<line>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</line>
<line>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</line>
<line>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</line>
<line>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</line>
<line>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</line>
<line>Whole misadventured piteous overthrows</line>
<line>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</line>
<line>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</line>
<line>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</line>
<line>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</line>
<line>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</line>
<line>The which if you with patient ears attend,</line>
<line>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</line>

<line>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;</line>
<line>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</line>
<line>That westward rooteth from the city's side,</line>
<line>So early walking did I see your son:</line>
<line>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me</line>
<line>And stole into the covert of the wood:</line>
<line>I, measuring his affections by my own,</line>
<line>That most are busied when they're most alone,</line>
<line>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,</line>

<line>Should in the furthest east begin to draw</line>
<line>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,</line>
<line>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,</line>
<line>And private in his chamber pens himself,</line>

<line>So far from sounding and discovery,</line>
<line>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</line>
<line>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</line>

<line>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;</line>

<line>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.</line>
<line>She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes</line>
<line>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone</line>
<line>On the fore-finger of an alderman,</line>
<line>Drawn with a team of little atomies</line>
<line>Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;</line>
<line>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,</line>
<line>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</line>
<line>The traces of the smallest spider's web,</line>
<line>The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,</line>
<line>Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,</line>
<line>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,</line>
<line>Not so big as a round little worm</line>
<line>Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;</line>
<line>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut</line>
<line>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</line>
<line>Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.</line>
<line>And in this state she gallops night by night</line>
<line>Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;</line>
<line>O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,</line>
<line>O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,</line>
<line>O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,</line>
<line>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</line>
<line>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:</line>
<line>Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,</line>
<line>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</line>
<line>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail</line>
<line>Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,</line>
<line>Then dreams, he of another benefice:</line>
<line>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,</line>
<line>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</line>
<line>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</line>
<line>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon</line>
<line>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</line>
<line>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</line>
<line>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</line>
<line>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</line>
<line>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</line>
<line>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</line>
<line>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</line>
<line>That presses them and learns them first to bear,</line>

<line>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</line>
<line>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</line>
<line>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</line>
<line>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</line>
<line>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</line>
<line>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</line>
<line>Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</line>
<line>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</line>
<line>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</line>
<line>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</line>
<line>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</line>
<line>And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</line>
<line>To rid her from this second marriage,</line>
<line>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</line>
<line>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</line>
<line>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</line>
<line>As I intended, for it wrought on her</line>
<line>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</line>
<line>That he should hither come as this dire night,</line>
<line>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</line>
<line>Being the time the potion's force should cease.</line>
<line>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</line>
<line>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</line>
<line>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</line>
<line>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</line>
<line>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</line>
<line>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</line>
<line>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</line>
<line>But when I came, some minute ere the time</line>
<line>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</line>
<line>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</line>
<line>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</line>
<line>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</line>
<line>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</line>
<line>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</line>
<line>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</line>
<line>All this I know; and to the marriage</line>
<line>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</line>
<line>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</line>
<line>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</line>
<line>Unto the rigour of severest law.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE</speaker>
<line>This letter doth make good the friar's words,</line>

<line>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</line>
<line>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</line>
<line>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</line>
<line>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</line>
