<line>O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than</line>

<line>in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;</line>

<line>let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put</line>
<line>thyself into the trick of singularity;' and</line>
<line>consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad</line>

<line>habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have</line>
<line>limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me</line>
<line>thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this</line>
