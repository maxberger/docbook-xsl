<speaker role="speaker">RUMOUR</speaker>
<line>Open your ears; for which of you will stop</line>
<line>The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?</line>
<line>I, from the orient to the drooping west,</line>
<line>Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</line>
<line>The acts commenced on this ball of earth:</line>
<line>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</line>
<line>The which in every language I pronounce,</line>
<line>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</line>
<line>I speak of peace, while covert enmity</line>
<line>Under the smile of safety wounds the world:</line>
<line>And who but Rumour, who but only I,</line>
<line>Make fearful musters and prepared defence,</line>
<line>Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,</line>
<line>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</line>
<line>And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe</line>
<line>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures</line>
<line>And of so easy and so plain a stop</line>
<line>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</line>
<line>The still-discordant wavering multitude,</line>
<line>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</line>
<line>My well-known body to anatomize</line>
<line>Among my household? Why is Rumour here?</line>
<line>I run before King Harry's victory;</line>
<line>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</line>
<line>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</line>
<line>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</line>
<line>Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I</line>
<line>To speak so true at first? my office is</line>
<line>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</line>
<line>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,</line>
<line>And that the king before the Douglas' rage</line>
<line>Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.</line>
<line>This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns</line>
<line>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</line>
<line>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</line>
<line>Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,</line>
<line>Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,</line>
<line>And not a man of them brings other news</line>
<line>Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues</line>
<line>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than</line>
<line>true wrongs.</line>

<line>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back</line>
<line>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,</line>
<line>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard</line>
<line>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</line>
<line>That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</line>
<line>He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him</line>
<line>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</line>
<line>He told me that rebellion had bad luck</line>
<line>And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.</line>
<line>With that, he gave his able horse the head,</line>
<line>And bending forward struck his armed heels</line>
<line>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</line>
<line>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</line>
<line>He seem'd in running to devour the way,</line>
<line>Staying no longer question.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<line>How doth my son and brother?</line>
<line>Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek</line>
<line>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</line>
<line>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</line>
<line>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</line>
<line>Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,</line>
<line>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</line>
<line>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</line>
<line>And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.</line>
<line>This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;</line>
<line>Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'</line>
<line>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:</line>
<line>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</line>

<line>Why, he is dead.</line>
<line>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</line>
<line>He that but fears the thing he would not know</line>
<line>Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes</line>
<line>That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;</line>
<line>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</line>

<line>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<line>Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.</line>
<line>I see a strange confession in thine eye:</line>
<line>Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin</line>
<line>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</line>
<line>The tongue offends not that reports his death:</line>
<line>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</line>
<line>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</line>
<line>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</line>
<line>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</line>
<line>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</line>
<line>Remember'd tolling a departing friend.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</speaker>
<line>I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">MORTON</speaker>
<line>I am sorry I should force you to believe</line>
<line>That which I would to God I had not seen;</line>
<line>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</line>
<line>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,</line>
<line>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</line>
<line>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</line>
<line>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</line>
<line>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</line>
<line>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</line>
<line>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</line>
<line>From the best temper'd courage in his troops;</line>
<line>For from his metal was his party steel'd;</line>
<line>Which once in him abated, all the rest</line>
<line>Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:</line>
<line>And as the thing that's heavy in itself,</line>
<line>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</line>
<line>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,</line>
<line>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</line>
<line>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</line>
<line>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</line>
<line>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester</line>
<line>Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</line>
<line>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword</line>
<line>Had three times slain the appearance of the king,</line>
<line>'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</line>
<line>Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,</line>
<line>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</line>
<line>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out</line>
<line>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</line>
<line>Under the conduct of young Lancaster</line>
<line>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</line>

<line>And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,</line>
<line>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</line>
<line>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</line>
<line>Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,</line>
<line>Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,</line>
<line>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!</line>
<line>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</line>
<line>Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!</line>
<line>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head</line>
<line>Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.</line>
<line>Now bind my brows with iron; and approach</line>
<line>The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring</line>
<line>To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!</line>
<line>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand</line>
<line>Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!</line>
<line>And let this world no longer be a stage</line>
<line>To feed contention in a lingering act;</line>
<line>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</line>
<line>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</line>

<line>The lives of all your loving complices</line>

<line>To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</line>
<line>You cast the event of war, my noble lord,</line>
<line>And summ'd the account of chance, before you said</line>
<line>'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,</line>
<line>That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:</line>
<line>You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,</line>
<line>More likely to fall in than to get o'er;</line>
<line>You were advised his flesh was capable</line>
<line>Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit</line>
<line>Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:</line>
<line>Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,</line>
<line>Though strongly apprehended, could restrain</line>
<line>The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,</line>
<line>Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,</line>

<line>Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;</line>

<line>'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,</line>
<line>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,</line>
<line>The gentle Archbishop of York is up</line>
<line>With well-appointed powers: he is a man</line>
<line>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</line>
<line>My lord your son had only but the corpse,</line>
<line>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</line>
<line>For that same word, rebellion, did divide</line>
<line>The action of their bodies from their souls;</line>
<line>And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,</line>
<line>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</line>
<line>Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,</line>
<line>This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</line>
<line>As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop</line>
<line>Turns insurrection to religion:</line>
<line>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,</line>
<line>He's followed both with body and with mind;</line>
<line>And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</line>
<line>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;</line>
<line>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</line>
<line>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</line>
<line>Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;</line>
<line>And more and less do flock to follow him.</line>

<speaker role="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<line>I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,</line>
<line>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.</line>
<line>Go in with me; and counsel every man</line>

<line>Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:</line>

<line>further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in</line>
<line>judgment and understanding; and he that will caper</line>
<line>with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the</line>
<line>money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that</line>
<line>the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,</line>
<line>and you took it like a sensible lord. I have</line>

<line>hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third</line>
<line>word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's</line>
<line>tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a</line>
<line>man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'</line>
<line>was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked</line>
<line>radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it</line>
<line>with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his</line>
<line>dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'</line>
<line>was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a</line>

<line>ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those</line>
<line>tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the</line>
<line>carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or</line>
<line>his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger</line>
<line>become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a</line>
<line>Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and</line>
<line>I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the</line>
<line>Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding</line>
<line>among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a</line>
<line>Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have</line>
<line>thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the</line>
<line>case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a</line>
<line>court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll</line>
<line>be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall</line>

<line>Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.</line>
<line>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</line>
<line>I take not on me here as a physician,</line>
<line>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</line>
<line>Troop in the throngs of military men;</line>
<line>But rather show awhile like fearful war,</line>
<line>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</line>
<line>And purge the obstructions which begin to stop</line>
<line>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</line>
<line>I have in equal balance justly weigh'd</line>
<line>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</line>
<line>And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</line>
<line>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</line>
<line>And are enforced from our most quiet there</line>
<line>By the rough torrent of occasion;</line>
<line>And have the summary of all our griefs,</line>
<line>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</line>
<line>Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,</line>
<line>And might by no suit gain our audience:</line>
<line>When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,</line>
<line>We are denied access unto his person</line>
<line>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</line>
<line>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</line>
<line>Whose memory is written on the earth</line>
<line>With yet appearing blood, and the examples</line>
<line>Of every minute's instance, present now,</line>
<line>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</line>

<line>The king that loved him, as the state stood then,</line>
<line>Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:</line>
<line>And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,</line>
<line>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</line>
<line>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</line>
<line>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</line>
<line>Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel</line>
<line>And the loud trumpet blowing them together,</line>
<line>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd</line>
<line>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</line>
<line>O when the king did throw his warder down,</line>
<line>His own life hung upon the staff he threw;</line>

<line>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</line>
<line>The Earl of Hereford was reputed then</line>
<line>In England the most valiant gentlemen:</line>
<line>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?</line>
<line>But if your father had been victor there,</line>
<line>He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:</line>
<line>For all the country in a general voice</line>
<line>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</line>
<line>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on</line>
<line>And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.</line>
<line>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</line>
<line>Here come I from our princely general</line>
<line>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace</line>
<line>That he will give you audience; and wherein</line>
<line>It shall appear that your demands are just,</line>

<line>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</line>

<line>No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary</line>

<line>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</line>
<line>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</line>
<line>That may repeat and history his loss</line>
<line>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</line>
<line>He cannot so precisely weed this land</line>
<line>As his misdoubts present occasion:</line>
<line>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</line>
<line>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</line>
<line>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:</line>
<line>So that this land, like an offensive wife</line>
<line>That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,</line>
<line>As he is striking, holds his infant up</line>
<line>And hangs resolved correction in the arm</line>
<line>That was uprear'd to execution.</line>

<line>I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than</line>
<line>your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-</line>
<line>blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make</line>
<line>him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.</line>
<line>There's never none of these demure boys come to any</line>
<line>proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,</line>
<line>and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a</line>
<line>kind of male green-sickness; and then when they</line>
<line>marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools</line>
<line>and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for</line>
<line>inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold</line>
<line>operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;</line>
<line>dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy</line>
<line>vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,</line>
<line>quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and</line>
<line>delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the</line>
<line>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes</line>
<line>excellent wit. The second property of your</line>
<line>excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;</line>
<line>which, before cold and settled, left the liver</line>
<line>white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity</line>
<line>and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes</line>
<line>it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:</line>
<line>it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives</line>
<line>warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,</line>
<line>man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and</line>
<line>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,</line>
<line>the heart, who, great and puffed up with this</line>
<line>retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour</line>
<line>comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is</line>
<line>nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and</line>
<line>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till</line>
<line>sack commences it and sets it in act and use.</line>
<line>Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for</line>
<line>the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his</line>
<line>father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,</line>
<line>manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent</line>
<line>endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile</line>
<line>sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If</line>
<line>I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I</line>
<line>would teach them should be, to forswear thin</line>
<line>potations and to addict themselves to sack.</line>

<line>Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,</line>
<line>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</line>
<line>By seeming cold or careless of his will;</line>
<line>For he is gracious, if he be observed:</line>
<line>He hath a tear for pity and a hand</line>
<line>Open as day for melting charity:</line>
<line>Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,</line>
<line>As humorous as winter and as sudden</line>
<line>As flaws congealed in the spring of day.</line>
<line>His temper, therefore, must be well observed:</line>
<line>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</line>
<line>When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;</line>
<line>But, being moody, give him line and scope,</line>
<line>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</line>
<line>Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,</line>
<line>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</line>
<line>A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</line>
<line>That the united vessel of their blood,</line>
<line>Mingled with venom of suggestion--</line>
<line>As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--</line>

<line>That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.</line>
<line>Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours</line>

<line>Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:</line>
<line>Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,</line>
<line>And thou wilt have me die assured of it.</line>
<line>Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,</line>
<line>Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,</line>
<line>To stab at half an hour of my life.</line>
<line>What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?</line>
<line>Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,</line>
<line>And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear</line>
<line>That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.</line>
<line>Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse</line>
<line>Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:</line>
<line>Only compound me with forgotten dust</line>
<line>Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.</line>
<line>Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;</line>
<line>For now a time is come to mock at form:</line>

<line>Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!</line>
<line>And to the English court assemble now,</line>
<line>From every region, apes of idleness!</line>
<line>Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:</line>
<line>Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,</line>
<line>Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit</line>
<line>The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?</line>
<line>Be happy, he will trouble you no more;</line>
<line>England shall double gild his treble guilt,</line>
<line>England shall give him office, honour, might;</line>
<line>For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks</line>
<line>The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog</line>
<line>Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.</line>
<line>O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!</line>
<line>When that my care could not withhold thy riots,</line>

<line>O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,</line>
<line>The moist impediments unto my speech,</line>
<line>I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke</line>
<line>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</line>
<line>The course of it so far. There is your crown;</line>
<line>And He that wears the crown immortally</line>
<line>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more</line>
<line>Than as your honour and as your renown,</line>
<line>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</line>
<line>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</line>
<line>Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.</line>
<line>God witness with me, when I here came in,</line>
<line>And found no course of breath within your majesty,</line>
<line>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</line>
<line>O, let me in my present wildness die</line>
<line>And never live to show the incredulous world</line>
<line>The noble change that I have purposed!</line>
<line>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</line>
<line>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</line>
<line>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</line>
<line>And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending</line>
<line>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</line>
<line>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:</line>
<line>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</line>
<line>Preserving life in medicine potable;</line>
<line>But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,</line>
<line>Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,</line>
<line>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</line>
<line>To try with it, as with an enemy</line>
<line>That had before my face murder'd my father,</line>
<line>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</line>
<line>But if it did infect my blood with joy,</line>
<line>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;</line>
<line>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</line>
<line>Did with the least affection of a welcome</line>
<line>Give entertainment to the might of it,</line>
<line>Let God for ever keep it from my head</line>
<line>And make me as the poorest vassal is</line>
<line>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</line>

<line>O my son,</line>
<line>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,</line>
<line>That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,</line>
<line>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</line>
<line>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;</line>
<line>And hear, I think, the very latest counsel</line>

<line>By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways</line>
<line>I met this crown; and I myself know well</line>
<line>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</line>
<line>To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,</line>
<line>Better opinion, better confirmation;</line>
<line>For all the soil of the achievement goes</line>
<line>With me into the earth. It seem'd in me</line>
<line>But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,</line>
<line>And I had many living to upbraid</line>
<line>My gain of it by their assistances;</line>
<line>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</line>
<line>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears</line>
<line>Thou see'st with peril I have answered;</line>
<line>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</line>
<line>Acting that argument: and now my death</line>
<line>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,</line>
<line>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</line>
<line>So thou the garland wear'st successively.</line>
<line>Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,</line>
<line>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</line>
<line>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</line>
<line>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;</line>
<line>By whose fell working I was first advanced</line>
<line>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</line>
<line>To be again displaced: which to avoid,</line>
<line>I cut them off; and had a purpose now</line>
<line>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</line>
<line>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</line>
<line>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</line>
<line>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</line>
<line>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</line>
<line>May waste the memory of the former days.</line>
<line>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</line>

<line>And I do wish your honours may increase,</line>
<line>Till you do live to see a son of mine</line>
<line>Offend you and obey you, as I did.</line>
<line>So shall I live to speak my father's words:</line>
<line>'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,</line>
<line>That dares do justice on my proper son;</line>
<line>And not less happy, having such a son,</line>
<line>That would deliver up his greatness so</line>
<line>Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:</line>
<line>For which, I do commit into your hand</line>
<line>The unstained sword that you have used to bear;</line>
<line>With this remembrance, that you use the same</line>
<line>With the like bold, just and impartial spirit</line>
<line>As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.</line>
<line>You shall be as a father to my youth:</line>
<line>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</line>
<line>And I will stoop and humble my intents</line>
<line>To your well-practised wise directions.</line>
<line>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;</line>
<line>My father is gone wild into his grave,</line>
<line>For in his tomb lie my affections;</line>
<line>And with his spirit sadly I survive,</line>
<line>To mock the expectation of the world,</line>
<line>To frustrate prophecies and to raze out</line>
<line>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</line>
<line>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</line>
<line>Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:</line>
<line>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</line>
<line>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods</line>
<line>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</line>
<line>Now call we our high court of parliament:</line>
<line>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,</line>
<line>That the great body of our state may go</line>
<line>In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;</line>
<line>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</line>
<line>As things acquainted and familiar to us;</line>
<line>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</line>
<line>Our coronation done, we will accite,</line>
<line>As I before remember'd, all our state:</line>
<line>And, God consigning to my good intents,</line>
<line>No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,</line>
<line>God shorten Harry's happy life one day!</line>

<line>I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;</line>
<line>How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!</line>
<line>I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,</line>
<line>So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;</line>
<line>But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.</line>
<line>Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;</line>
<line>Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape</line>
<line>For thee thrice wider than for other men.</line>
<line>Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:</line>
<line>Presume not that I am the thing I was;</line>
<line>For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,</line>
<line>That I have turn'd away my former self;</line>
<line>So will I those that kept me company.</line>
<line>When thou dost hear I am as I have been,</line>
<line>Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,</line>
<line>The tutor and the feeder of my riots:</line>
<line>Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,</line>
<line>As I have done the rest of my misleaders,</line>
<line>Not to come near our person by ten mile.</line>
<line>For competence of life I will allow you,</line>
<line>That lack of means enforce you not to evil:</line>
<line>And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,</line>
<line>We will, according to your strengths and qualities,</line>
<line>Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,</line>
<line>To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.</line>

<para role="stagedir">Spoken by a Dancer</para>
<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker"/>
<line>First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.</line>
<line>My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;</line>
<line>and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look</line>
<line>for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have</line>
<line>to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I</line>
<line>should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.</line>
<line>But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it</line>
<line>known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here</line>
<line>in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your</line>
<line>patience for it and to promise you a better. I</line>
<line>meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an</line>
<line>ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and</line>
<line>you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you</line>
<line>I would be and here I commit my body to your</line>
<line>mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,</line>
<line>as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.</line>
<line>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will</line>
<line>you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but</line>
<line>light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a</line>
<line>good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,</line>
<line>and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have</line>
<line>forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the</line>
<line>gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which</line>
<line>was never seen before in such an assembly.</line>
<line>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too</line>
<line>much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will</line>
<line>continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make</line>
<line>you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for</line>
<line>any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,</line>
<line>unless already a' be killed with your hard</line>
<line>opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is</line>
<line>not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are</line>
<line>too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down</line>
<line>before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</line>
