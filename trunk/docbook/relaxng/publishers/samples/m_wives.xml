<line>distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul</line>

<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have</line>
<line>suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.</line>
<line>Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's</line>
<line>knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their</line>
<line>mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to</line>
<line>Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met</line>
<line>the jealous knave their master in the door, who</line>
<line>asked them once or twice what they had in their</line>
<line>basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave</line>
<line>would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he</line>
<line>should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he</line>
<line>for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But</line>
<line>mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs</line>
<line>of three several deaths; first, an intolerable</line>
<line>fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten</line>
<line>bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good</line>
<line>bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to</line>
<line>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,</line>
<line>like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes</line>
<line>that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a</line>
<line>man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject</line>
<line>to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution</line>
<line>and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.</line>
<line>And in the height of this bath, when I was more than</line>
<line>half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be</line>
<line>thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,</line>
<line>in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of</line>
