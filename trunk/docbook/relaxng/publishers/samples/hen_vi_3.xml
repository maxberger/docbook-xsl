<line>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</line>
<line>Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,</line>
<line>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</line>
<line>Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</line>
<line>I, then in London keeper of the king,</line>
<line>Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,</line>
<line>And very well appointed, as I thought,</line>
<line>March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,</line>
<line>Bearing the king in my behalf along;</line>
<line>For by my scouts I was advertised</line>

<line>Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met</line>

<line>But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,</line>
<line>Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,</line>
<line>That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;</line>
<line>Or whether 'twas report of her success;</line>
<line>Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,</line>
<line>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</line>
<line>I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,</line>
<line>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</line>
<line>Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,</line>
<line>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</line>
<line>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</line>
<line>I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,</line>
<line>With promise of high pay and great rewards:</line>
<line>But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</line>
<line>And we in them no hope to win the day;</line>
<line>So that we fled; the king unto the queen;</line>
<line>Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,</line>

<line>Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,</line>

<line>So do I wish the crown, being so far off;</line>
<line>And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;</line>
<line>And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,</line>
<line>Flattering me with impossibilities.</line>
<line>My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,</line>
<line>Unless my hand and strength could equal them.</line>
<line>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;</line>
<line>What other pleasure can the world afford?</line>
<line>I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,</line>
<line>And deck my body in gay ornaments,</line>
<line>And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</line>
<line>O miserable thought! and more unlikely</line>
<line>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</line>
<line>Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:</line>
<line>And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,</line>
<line>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</line>
<line>To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;</line>
<line>To make an envious mountain on my back,</line>
<line>Where sits deformity to mock my body;</line>
<line>To shape my legs of an unequal size;</line>
<line>To disproportion me in every part,</line>
<line>Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp</line>
<line>That carries no impression like the dam.</line>
<line>And am I then a man to be beloved?</line>
<line>O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!</line>
<line>Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,</line>
<line>But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such</line>
<line>As are of better person than myself,</line>
<line>I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</line>
<line>And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,</line>
<line>Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head</line>
<line>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</line>
<line>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</line>
<line>For many lives stand between me and home:</line>
<line>And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,</line>
<line>That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,</line>
<line>Seeking a way and straying from the way;</line>
<line>Not knowing how to find the open air,</line>
<line>But toiling desperately to find it out,--</line>
<line>Torment myself to catch the English crown:</line>
<line>And from that torment I will free myself,</line>
<line>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</line>
<line>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</line>
<line>And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,</line>
<line>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</line>
<line>And frame my face to all occasions.</line>
<line>I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;</line>
<line>I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;</line>
<line>I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,</line>
<line>Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,</line>
<line>And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.</line>
<line>I can add colours to the chameleon,</line>
<line>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</line>
<line>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.</line>
<line>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</line>

<line>Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,</line>

<line>Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,</line>
<line>My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.</line>
<line>That I must yield my body to the earth</line>
<line>And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.</line>
<line>Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,</line>
<line>Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,</line>
<line>Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,</line>
<line>Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree</line>
<line>And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.</line>
<line>These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,</line>
<line>Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,</line>
<line>To search the secret treasons of the world:</line>
<line>The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,</line>
<line>Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;</line>
<line>For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?</line>
<line>And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?</line>
<line>Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!</line>
<line>My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.</line>
<line>Even now forsake me, and of all my lands</line>
<line>Is nothing left me but my body's length.</line>
<line>Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?</line>

<line>Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,</line>
<line>Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.</line>
<line>And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,</line>
<line>Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,</line>
<line>And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,</line>
<line>And many an orphan's water-standing eye--</line>

<line>And orphans for their parents timeless death--</line>
<line>Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.</line>
<line>The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;</line>
<line>The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;</line>
<line>Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;</line>
<line>The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,</line>
<line>And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.</line>
<line>Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,</line>
<line>And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,</line>
<line>To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,</line>
<line>Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.</line>
<line>Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,</line>
<line>To signify thou camest to bite the world:</line>
<line>And, if the rest be true which I have heard,</line>
<line>Thou camest--</line>

<line>O, may such purple tears be alway shed</line>

<line>I came into the world with my legs forward:</line>
<line>Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,</line>
<line>And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?</line>
<line>The midwife wonder'd and the women cried</line>
<line>'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'</line>
<line>And so I was; which plainly signified</line>
<line>That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.</line>
<line>Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,</line>
<line>Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.</line>
<line>I have no brother, I am like no brother;</line>

<line>Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:</line>

<line>That Edward shall be fearful of his life,</line>
