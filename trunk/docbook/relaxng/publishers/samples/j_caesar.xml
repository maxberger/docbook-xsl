<line>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</line>

<line>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</line>
<line>Over your friend that loves you.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BRUTUS</speaker>
<line>Cassius,</line>
<line>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</line>
<line>I turn the trouble of my countenance</line>
<line>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</line>
<line>Of late with passions of some difference,</line>
<line>Conceptions only proper to myself,</line>
<line>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</line>
<line>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</line>
<line>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</line>
<line>Nor construe any further my neglect,</line>
<line>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</line>
<line>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CASSIUS</speaker>
<line>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</line>
<line>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</line>
<line>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</line>
<line>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BRUTUS</speaker>
<line>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</line>
<line>But by reflection, by some other things.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CASSIUS</speaker>
<line>'Tis just:</line>
<line>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</line>
<line>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</line>
<line>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</line>
<line>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</line>
<line>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</line>
<line>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</line>
<line>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</line>
<line>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</line>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CASSIUS</speaker>
<line>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</line>
<line>And since you know you cannot see yourself</line>
<line>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</line>
<line>Will modestly discover to yourself</line>
<line>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</line>
<line>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</line>
<line>Were I a common laugher, or did use</line>
<line>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</line>
<line>To every new protester; if you know</line>
<line>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</line>
<line>And after scandal them, or if you know</line>
<line>That I profess myself in banqueting</line>
<line>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</line>

<line>If it be aught toward the general good,</line>
<line>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</line>

<line>The name of honour more than I fear death.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">CASSIUS</speaker>
<line>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</line>
<line>As well as I do know your outward favour.</line>
<line>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</line>
<line>I cannot tell what you and other men</line>
<line>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</line>
<line>I had as lief not be as live to be</line>
<line>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</line>
<line>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</line>
<line>We both have fed as well, and we can both</line>
<line>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</line>
<line>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</line>
<line>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</line>
<line>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</line>
<line>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</line>
<line>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</line>
<line>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</line>
<line>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</line>
<line>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</line>
<line>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</line>
<line>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</line>
<line>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</line>
<line>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</line>
<line>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</line>
<line>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</line>
<line>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</line>
<line>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</line>
<line>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</line>
<line>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</line>
<line>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</line>
<line>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</line>
<line>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</line>
<line>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</line>
<line>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</line>
<line>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</line>
<line>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</line>
<line>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</line>
<line>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</line>
<line>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</line>
<line>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</line>
<line>A man of such a feeble temper should</line>
<line>So get the start of the majestic world</line>
<line>And bear the palm alone.</line>

<line>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</line>
<line>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</line>
<line>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</line>
<line>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</line>
<line>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</line>
<line>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</line>
<line>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</line>
<line>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</line>
<line>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</line>
<line>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</line>
<line>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</line>
<line>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</line>
<line>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</line>
<line>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</line>
<line>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</line>
<line>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</line>
<line>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</line>

<line>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</line>
<line>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</line>
<line>When there is in it but one only man.</line>
<line>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</line>
<line>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<line>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</line>
<line>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</line>
<line>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</line>
<line>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</line>
<line>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</line>
<line>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</line>
<line>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</line>
<line>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</line>
<line>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</line>
<line>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</line>
<line>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</line>
<line>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</line>
<line>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</line>
<line>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</line>
<line>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</line>
<line>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</line>
<line>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</line>

<line>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</line>
<line>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</line>
<line>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</line>
<line>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</line>
<line>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</line>
<line>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</line>
<line>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</line>

<line>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</line>

<line>I have not known when his affections sway'd</line>
<line>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</line>

<line>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</line>
<line>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</line>

<line>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</line>
<line>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</line>
<line>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</line>
<line>Would run to these and these extremities:</line>

<line>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</line>
<line>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</line>
<line>The evil that men do lives after them;</line>
<line>The good is oft interred with their bones;</line>
<line>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</line>
<line>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</line>
<line>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</line>
<line>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</line>
<line>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</line>
<line>For Brutus is an honourable man;</line>
<line>So are they all, all honourable men--</line>
<line>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</line>
<line>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</line>
<line>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</line>
<line>And Brutus is an honourable man.</line>
<line>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</line>
<line>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</line>
<line>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</line>
<line>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</line>
<line>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</line>
<line>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</line>
<line>And Brutus is an honourable man.</line>
<line>You all did see that on the Lupercal</line>
<line>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</line>
<line>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</line>
<line>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</line>
<line>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</line>
<line>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</line>
<line>But here I am to speak what I do know.</line>
<line>You all did love him once, not without cause:</line>
<line>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</line>
<line>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</line>
<line>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</line>
<line>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</line>
<line>And I must pause till it come back to me.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">First Citizen</speaker>
<line>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</line>

<line>Has he, masters?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<line>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;</line>

<line>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</line>

<line>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</line>
<line>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</line>
<line>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</line>
<line>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</line>
<line>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</line>
<line>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</line>
<line>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</line>
<line>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</line>
<line>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</line>
<line>Let but the commons hear this testament--</line>
<line>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</line>
<line>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</line>
<line>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</line>
<line>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</line>
<line>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</line>
<line>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</line>
<line>Unto their issue.</line>

<line>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</line>
<line>You all do know this mantle: I remember</line>
<line>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</line>
<line>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</line>
<line>That day he overcame the Nervii:</line>
<line>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</line>
<line>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</line>
<line>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</line>
<line>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</line>
<line>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</line>
<line>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</line>
<line>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</line>
<line>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</line>
<line>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</line>
<line>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</line>
<line>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</line>
<line>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</line>
<line>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</line>
<line>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</line>
<line>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</line>
<line>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</line>
<line>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</line>
<line>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</line>
<line>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</line>
<line>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</line>
<line>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</line>
<line>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</line>
<line>Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,</line>

<speaker role="speaker">CASSIUS</speaker>
<line>Messala,</line>
<line>This is my birth-day; as this very day</line>
<line>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:</line>
<line>Be thou my witness that against my will,</line>
<line>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</line>
<line>Upon one battle all our liberties.</line>
<line>You know that I held Epicurus strong</line>
<line>And his opinion: now I change my mind,</line>
<line>And partly credit things that do presage.</line>
<line>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</line>
<line>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</line>
<line>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</line>
<line>Who to Philippi here consorted us:</line>
<line>This morning are they fled away and gone;</line>
<line>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</line>
<line>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</line>
<line>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</line>
<line>A canopy most fatal, under which</line>
<line>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</line>

<line>Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</line>

<line>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?</line>

<speaker role="speaker">STRATO</speaker>
<line>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</line>
<line>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</line>
<line>For Brutus only overcame himself,</line>
<line>And no man else hath honour by his death.</line>

<line>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</line>
<line>All the conspirators save only he</line>
<line>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</line>
<line>He only, in a general honest thought</line>
<line>And common good to all, made one of them.</line>
<line>His life was gentle, and the elements</line>
<line>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</line>
<line>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</line>

<speaker role="speaker">OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<line>According to his virtue let us use him,</line>
<line>With all respect and rites of burial.</line>
<line>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</line>

<line>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</line>
<line>To part the glories of this happy day.</line>
