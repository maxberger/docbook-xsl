<line>In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,</line>
<line>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</line>

<line>Received deep scars in France and Normandy?</line>

<line>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</line>
<line>Edward the Black Prince died before his father</line>

<line>Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;</line>
<line>Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,</line>
<line>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</line>
<line>Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,</line>
<line>Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,</line>
<line>Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</line>

<line>We know the time since he was mild and affable,</line>
<line>And if we did but glance a far-off look,</line>
<line>Immediately he was upon his knee,</line>
<line>That all the court admired him for submission:</line>
<line>But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,</line>

<line>Disdaining duty that to us belongs.</line>
<line>Small curs are not regarded when they grin;</line>
<line>But great men tremble when the lion roars;</line>
<line>And Humphrey is no little man in England.</line>
<line>First note that he is near you in descent,</line>

<line>Me seemeth then it is no policy,</line>
<line>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</line>

<line>That he should come about your royal person</line>

<line>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</line>
