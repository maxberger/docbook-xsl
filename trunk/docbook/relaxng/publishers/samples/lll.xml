and DUMAIN</para>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</line>
<line>Live register'd upon our brazen tombs</line>
<line>And then grace us in the disgrace of death;</line>
<line>When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,</line>
<line>The endeavor of this present breath may buy</line>
<line>That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge</line>
<line>And make us heirs of all eternity.</line>
<line>Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,</line>
<line>That war against your own affections</line>
<line>And the huge army of the world's desires,--</line>
<line>Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:</line>
<line>Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;</line>
<line>Our court shall be a little Academe,</line>
<line>Still and contemplative in living art.</line>
<line>You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,</line>
<line>Have sworn for three years' term to live with me</line>
<line>My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes</line>
<line>That are recorded in this schedule here:</line>
<line>Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,</line>
<line>That his own hand may strike his honour down</line>
<line>That violates the smallest branch herein:</line>
<line>If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,</line>
<line>Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<line>I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:</line>
<line>The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:</line>
<line>Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits</line>
<line>Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUMAIN</speaker>
<line>My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:</line>
<line>The grosser manner of these world's delights</line>
<line>He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:</line>
<line>To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;</line>
<line>With all these living in philosophy.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>I can but say their protestation over;</line>
<line>So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,</line>
<line>That is, to live and study here three years.</line>
<line>But there are other strict observances;</line>
<line>As, not to see a woman in that term,</line>
<line>Which I hope well is not enrolled there;</line>
<line>And one day in a week to touch no food</line>
<line>And but one meal on every day beside,</line>
<line>The which I hope is not enrolled there;</line>
<line>And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,</line>
<line>And not be seen to wink of all the day--</line>
<line>When I was wont to think no harm all night</line>
<line>And make a dark night too of half the day--</line>
<line>Which I hope well is not enrolled there:</line>
<line>O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,</line>
<line>Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:</line>
<line>I only swore to study with your grace</line>
<line>And stay here in your court for three years' space.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<line>You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.</line>
<line>What is the end of study? let me know.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>Why, that to know, which else we should not know.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Come on, then; I will swear to study so,</line>
<line>To know the thing I am forbid to know:</line>
<line>As thus,--to study where I well may dine,</line>
<line>When I to feast expressly am forbid;</line>
<line>Or study where to meet some mistress fine,</line>
<line>When mistresses from common sense are hid;</line>
<line>Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,</line>
<line>Study to break it and not break my troth.</line>
<line>If study's gain be thus and this be so,</line>
<line>Study knows that which yet it doth not know:</line>
<line>Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>These be the stops that hinder study quite</line>
<line>And train our intellects to vain delight.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,</line>
<line>Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:</line>
<line>As, painfully to pore upon a book</line>
<line>To seek the light of truth; while truth the while</line>
<line>Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:</line>
<line>Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:</line>
<line>So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,</line>
<line>Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</line>
<line>Study me how to please the eye indeed</line>
<line>By fixing it upon a fairer eye,</line>
<line>Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed</line>
<line>And give him light that it was blinded by.</line>
<line>Study is like the heaven's glorious sun</line>
<line>That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:</line>
<line>Small have continual plodders ever won</line>
<line>Save base authority from others' books</line>
<line>These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights</line>
<line>That give a name to every fixed star</line>
<line>Have no more profit of their shining nights</line>
<line>Than those that walk and wot not what they are.</line>
<line>Too much to know is to know nought but fame;</line>
<line>And every godfather can give a name.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>How well he's read, to reason against reading!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUMAIN</speaker>
<line>Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<line>He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUMAIN</speaker>
<line>How follows that?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Fit in his place and time.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">DUMAIN</speaker>
<line>In reason nothing.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Something then in rhyme.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,</line>
<line>That bites the first-born infants of the spring.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast</line>
<line>Before the birds have any cause to sing?</line>
<line>Why should I joy in any abortive birth?</line>
<line>At Christmas I no more desire a rose</line>
<line>Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;</line>
<line>But like of each thing that in season grows.</line>
<line>So you, to study now it is too late,</line>
<line>Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:</line>
<line>And though I have for barbarism spoke more</line>
<line>Than for that angel knowledge you can say,</line>
<line>Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore</line>
<line>And bide the penance of each three years' day.</line>
<line>Give me the paper; let me read the same;</line>
<line>And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<line><phrase role="stagedir">Reads</phrase>  'Item, That no woman shall come within a</line>

<speaker role="speaker">LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<line>Four days ago.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Let's see the penalty.</line>
<para role="stagedir">Reads</para>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<line>Marry, that did I.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Sweet lord, and why?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<line>To fright them hence with that dread penalty.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>A dangerous law against gentility!</line>
<para role="stagedir">Reads</para>
<line>'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman</line>
<line>within the term of three years, he shall endure such</line>
<line>public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'</line>
<line>This article, my liege, yourself must break;</line>
<line>For well you know here comes in embassy</line>
<line>The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--</line>
<line>A maid of grace and complete majesty--</line>
<line>About surrender up of Aquitaine</line>
<line>To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:</line>
<line>Therefore this article is made in vain,</line>
<line>Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>So study evermore is overshot:</line>
<line>While it doth study to have what it would</line>
<line>It doth forget to do the thing it should,</line>
<line>And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,</line>
<line>'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>We must of force dispense with this decree;</line>
<line>She must lie here on mere necessity.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Necessity will make us all forsworn</line>
<line>Three thousand times within this three years' space;</line>
<line>For every man with his affects is born,</line>
<line>Not by might master'd but by special grace:</line>
<line>If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;</line>
<line>I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'</line>
<line>So to the laws at large I write my name:</line>
<para role="stagedir">Subscribes</para>
<line>And he that breaks them in the least degree</line>
<line>Stands in attainder of eternal shame:</line>
<line>Suggestions are to other as to me;</line>
<line>But I believe, although I seem so loath,</line>
<line>I am the last that will last keep his oath.</line>
<line>But is there no quick recreation granted?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line>Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted</line>
<line>With a refined traveller of Spain;</line>
<line>A man in all the world's new fashion planted,</line>
<line>That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;</line>
<line>One whom the music of his own vain tongue</line>
<line>Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;</line>
<line>A man of complements, whom right and wrong</line>
<line>Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:</line>
<line>This child of fancy, that Armado hight,</line>
<line>For interim to our studies shall relate</line>
<line>In high-born words the worth of many a knight</line>
<line>From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.</line>
<line>How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;</line>
<line>But, I protest, I love to hear him lie</line>
<line>And I will use him for my minstrelsy.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BIRON</speaker>
<line>Armado is a most illustrious wight,</line>
<line>A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<line>Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;</line>

<line>'Tis more than need.</line>
<line>Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.</line>
<line>Consider what you first did swear unto,</line>
<line>To fast, to study, and to see no woman;</line>
<line>Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.</line>
<line>Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;</line>
<line>And abstinence engenders maladies.</line>
<line>And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,</line>
<line>In that each of you have forsworn his book,</line>
<line>Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?</line>
<line>For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,</line>
<line>Have found the ground of study's excellence</line>
<line>Without the beauty of a woman's face?</line>
<para role="stagedir">From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;
They are the ground, the books, the academes
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire</para>
<line>Why, universal plodding poisons up</line>
<line>The nimble spirits in the arteries,</line>
<line>As motion and long-during action tires</line>
<line>The sinewy vigour of the traveller.</line>
<line>Now, for not looking on a woman's face,</line>
<line>You have in that forsworn the use of eyes</line>
<line>And study too, the causer of your vow;</line>
<line>For where is any author in the world</line>
<line>Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?</line>
<line>Learning is but an adjunct to ourself</line>
<line>And where we are our learning likewise is:</line>
<line>Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,</line>
<line>Do we not likewise see our learning there?</line>
<line>O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</line>
<line>And in that vow we have forsworn our books.</line>
<line>For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</line>
<line>In leaden contemplation have found out</line>
<line>Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes</line>
<line>Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?</line>
<line>Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;</line>
<line>And therefore, finding barren practisers,</line>
<line>Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:</line>
<line>But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,</line>
<line>Lives not alone immured in the brain;</line>
<line>But, with the motion of all elements,</line>
<line>Courses as swift as thought in every power,</line>
<line>And gives to every power a double power,</line>
<line>Above their functions and their offices.</line>
<line>It adds a precious seeing to the eye;</line>
<line>A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;</line>
<line>A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,</line>
<line>When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:</line>
<line>Love's feeling is more soft and sensible</line>
<line>Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;</line>
<line>Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:</line>
<line>For valour, is not Love a Hercules,</line>
<line>Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</line>
<line>Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical</line>
<line>As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:</line>
<line>And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</line>
<line>Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.</line>
<line>Never durst poet touch a pen to write</line>
<line>Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;</line>
<line>O, then his lines would ravish savage ears</line>
<line>And plant in tyrants mild humility.</line>
<line>From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:</line>
<line>They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;</line>
<line>They are the books, the arts, the academes,</line>
<line>That show, contain and nourish all the world:</line>
<line>Else none at all in ought proves excellent.</line>
<line>Then fools you were these women to forswear,</line>
<line>Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</line>
<line>For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,</line>
<line>Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,</line>
<line>Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,</line>
<line>Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,</line>
<line>Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,</line>
<line>Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</line>
<line>It is religion to be thus forsworn,</line>
<line>For charity itself fulfills the law,</line>
<line>And who can sever love from charity?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BOYET</speaker>
<line>Under the cool shade of a sycamore</line>
<line>I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;</line>
<line>When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,</line>
<line>Toward that shade I might behold addrest</line>
<line>The king and his companions: warily</line>
<line>I stole into a neighbour thicket by,</line>
<line>And overheard what you shall overhear,</line>
<line>That, by and by, disguised they will be here.</line>
<line>Their herald is a pretty knavish page,</line>
<line>That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:</line>
<line>Action and accent did they teach him there;</line>
<line>'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'</line>
<line>And ever and anon they made a doubt</line>
<line>Presence majestical would put him out,</line>
<line>'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;</line>
<line>Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'</line>
<line>The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;</line>
<line>I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'</line>
<line>With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,</line>
<line>Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:</line>
<line>One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore</line>
<line>A better speech was never spoke before;</line>
<line>Another, with his finger and his thumb,</line>
<line>Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'</line>
<line>The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'</line>
<line>The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.</line>
<line>With that, they all did tumble on the ground,</line>
<line>With such a zealous laughter, so profound,</line>
<line>That in this spleen ridiculous appears,</line>
<line>To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCESS</speaker>
<line>But what, but what, come they to visit us?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BOYET</speaker>
<line>They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.</line>
<line>Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.</line>
<line>Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;</line>
<line>And every one his love-feat will advance</line>
<line>Unto his several mistress, which they'll know</line>
<line>By favours several which they did bestow.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCESS</speaker>
<line>And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;</line>
<line>For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;</line>
<line>And not a man of them shall have the grace,</line>
<line>Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.</line>
<line>Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,</line>
<line>And then the king will court thee for his dear;</line>
<line>Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,</line>
<line>So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.</line>
<line>And change your favours too; so shall your loves</line>
<line>Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">ROSALINE</speaker>
<line>Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.</line>

<line>But in this changing what is your intent?</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCESS</speaker>
<line>The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:</line>

<line>And mock for mock is only my intent.</line>
<line>Their several counsels they unbosom shall</line>
<line>To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCESS</speaker>
<line>No, to the death, we will not move a foot;</line>

<line>But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">BOYET</speaker>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCESS</speaker>
<line>Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt</line>
<line>The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out</line>
<line>There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,</line>
<line>To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:</line>
<line>So shall we stay, mocking intended game,</line>
<line>And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.</line>

<line>The liberal opposition of our spirits,</line>

<line>The extreme parts of time extremely forms</line>
<line>All causes to the purpose of his speed,</line>

<line>That which long process could not arbitrate:</line>
<line>And though the mourning brow of progeny</line>
<line>Forbid the smiling courtesy of love</line>
<line>The holy suit which fain it would convince,</line>
<line>Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,</line>
<line>Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it</line>
<line>From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost</line>
<line>Is not by much so wholesome-profitable</line>

<line>Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;</line>
<line>And by these badges understand the king.</line>
<line>For your fair sakes have we neglected time,</line>
<line>Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,</line>
<line>Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours</line>
<line>Even to the opposed end of our intents:</line>
<line>And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--</line>
<line>As love is full of unbefitting strains,</line>
<line>All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,</line>
<line>Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,</line>
<line>Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,</line>
<line>Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll</line>
<line>To every varied object in his glance:</line>
<line>Which parti-coated presence of loose love</line>
<line>Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,</line>
<line>Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,</line>
<line>Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,</line>
<line>Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,</line>
<line>Our love being yours, the error that love makes</line>
<line>Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,</line>
<line>By being once false for ever to be true</line>
<line>To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:</line>
<line>And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,</line>
<line>Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.</line>

<line>You will do aught, this shall you do for me:</line>
<line>Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed</line>
<line>To some forlorn and naked hermitage,</line>

<line>There stay until the twelve celestial signs</line>

<line>Change not your offer made in heat of blood;</line>
<line>If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds</line>
<line>Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,</line>

<line>Then, at the expiration of the year,</line>
<line>Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,</line>

<line>I will be thine; and till that instant shut</line>
<line>My woeful self up in a mourning house,</line>
<line>Raining the tears of lamentation</line>
<line>For the remembrance of my father's death.</line>
