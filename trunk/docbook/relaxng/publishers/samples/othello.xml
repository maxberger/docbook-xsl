<speaker role="speaker">RODERIGO</speaker>
<line>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</line>
<line>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</line>
<line>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">IAGO</speaker>
<line>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</line>
<line>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</line>
<line>Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</line>
<line>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</line>
<line>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</line>
<line>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</line>
<line>Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</line>
<line>And, in conclusion,</line>
<line>Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</line>
<line>'I have already chose my officer.'</line>
<line>And what was he?</line>
<line>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</line>
<line>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</line>
<line>A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</line>
<line>That never set a squadron in the field,</line>
<line>Nor the division of a battle knows</line>
<line>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</line>
<line>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</line>
<line>As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</line>
<line>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</line>
<line>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</line>
<line>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</line>
<line>Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</line>
<line>By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</line>
<line>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</line>
<line>And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</line>

<line>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">IAGO</speaker>
<line>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</line>
<line>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</line>
<line>And not by old gradation, where each second</line>
<line>Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</line>
<line>Whether I in any just term am affined</line>
<line>To love the Moor.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">RODERIGO</speaker>
<line>I would not follow him then.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">IAGO</speaker>
<line>O, sir, content you;</line>
<line>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</line>
<line>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</line>
<line>Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</line>
<line>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</line>
<line>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</line>
<line>Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</line>
<line>For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</line>
<line>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</line>
<line>Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</line>
<line>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</line>
<line>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</line>
<line>Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</line>
<line>their coats</line>
<line>Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</line>
<line>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</line>
<line>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</line>
<line>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</line>
<line>In following him, I follow but myself;</line>
<line>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</line>
<line>But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</line>
<line>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</line>
<line>The native act and figure of my heart</line>
<line>In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</line>
<line>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</line>
<line>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</line>

<line>As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</line>
<line>At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</line>
<line>Transported, with no worse nor better guard</line>
<line>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</line>
<line>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--</line>
<line>If this be known to you and your allowance,</line>
<line>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</line>
<line>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</line>
<line>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</line>
<line>That, from the sense of all civility,</line>
<line>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</line>
<line>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</line>
<line>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</line>
<line>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</line>
<line>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</line>
<line>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</line>
<line>If she be in her chamber or your house,</line>
<line>Let loose on me the justice of the state</line>

<line>My very noble and approved good masters,</line>

<line>The very head and front of my offending</line>
<line>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</line>
<line>And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:</line>
<line>For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,</line>
<line>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</line>
<line>Their dearest action in the tented field,</line>
<line>And little of this great world can I speak,</line>
<line>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</line>
<line>And therefore little shall I grace my cause</line>
<line>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</line>
<line>I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver</line>
<line>Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,</line>
<line>What conjuration and what mighty magic,</line>

<line>To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</line>
<line>It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect</line>

<line>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</line>
<line>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</line>

<line>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</line>

<line>'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:</line>
<line>She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd</line>

<line>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</line>
<line>I should but teach him how to tell my story.</line>
<line>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</line>
<line>She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,</line>
<line>And I loved her that she did pity them.</line>

<line>distract it with many, either to have it sterile</line>

<line>his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou</line>
<line>shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but</line>

<line>their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food</line>

<line>change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</line>
<line>she will find the error of her choice: she must</line>
<line>have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</line>
<line>purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</line>
<line>more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</line>
<line>thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</line>
<line>an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</line>
<line>too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</line>

<line>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:</line>
<line>I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,</line>
<line>When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?</line>
<line>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</line>
<line>In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'</line>
<line>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</line>
<line>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</line>

<line>I think thou dost;</line>
<line>And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,</line>
<line>And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,</line>
<line>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</line>
<line>For such things in a false disloyal knave</line>
<line>Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just</line>
<line>They are close delations, working from the heart</line>
<line>That passion cannot rule.</line>

<line>Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:</line>

<line>Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would</line>

<line>But I do think it is their husbands' faults</line>
<line>If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,</line>
<line>And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</line>
<line>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</line>
<line>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</line>
<line>Or scant our former having in despite;</line>
<line>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</line>
<line>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</line>
<line>Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell</line>
<line>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</line>
<line>As husbands have. What is it that they do</line>
<line>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</line>
<line>I think it is: and doth affection breed it?</line>
<line>I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?</line>
<line>It is so too: and have not we affections,</line>
<line>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</line>
