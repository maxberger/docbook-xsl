<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<line>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</line>
<line>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</line>
<line>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</line>
<line>To be commenced in strands afar remote.</line>
<line>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</line>
<line>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;</line>
<line>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,</line>
<line>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</line>
<line>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,</line>
<line>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</line>
<line>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</line>
<line>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</line>
<line>And furious close of civil butchery</line>
<line>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</line>
<line>March all one way and be no more opposed</line>
<line>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:</line>
<line>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</line>
<line>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</line>
<line>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,</line>
<line>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</line>
<line>We are impressed and engaged to fight,</line>
<line>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;</line>
<line>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb</line>
<line>To chase these pagans in those holy fields</line>
<line>Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet</line>
<line>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd</line>
<line>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</line>
<line>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</line>
<line>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:</line>
<line>Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</line>
<line>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</line>
<line>What yesternight our council did decree</line>
<line>In forwarding this dear expedience.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<line>My liege, this haste was hot in question,</line>
<line>And many limits of the charge set down</line>
<line>But yesternight: when all athwart there came</line>
<line>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</line>
<line>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,</line>
<line>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</line>
<line>Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</line>
<line>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</line>
<line>A thousand of his people butchered;</line>
<line>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</line>
<line>Such beastly shameless transformation,</line>
<line>By those Welshwomen done as may not be</line>
<line>Without much shame retold or spoken of.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<line>It seems then that the tidings of this broil</line>
<line>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<line>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;</line>
<line>For more uneven and unwelcome news</line>
<line>Came from the north and thus it did import:</line>
<line>On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,</line>
<line>Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,</line>
<line>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</line>
<line>At Holmedon met,</line>
<line>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</line>
<line>As by discharge of their artillery,</line>
<line>And shape of likelihood, the news was told;</line>
<line>For he that brought them, in the very heat</line>
<line>And pride of their contention did take horse,</line>
<line>Uncertain of the issue any way.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<line>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</line>
<line>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.</line>
<line>Stain'd with the variation of each soil</line>
<line>Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</line>
<line>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</line>
<line>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</line>
<line>Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</line>
<line>Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see</line>
<line>On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</line>
<line>Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son</line>
<line>To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,</line>
<line>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:</line>
<line>And is not this an honourable spoil?</line>
<line>A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<line>In faith,</line>
<line>It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<line>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin</line>
<line>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</line>
<line>Should be the father to so blest a son,</line>
<line>A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;</line>
<line>Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;</line>
<line>Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:</line>
<line>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</line>
<line>See riot and dishonour stain the brow</line>
<line>Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved</line>
<line>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged</line>
<line>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</line>
<line>And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</line>
<line>Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.</line>
<line>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</line>
<line>Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,</line>
<line>Which he in this adventure hath surprised,</line>
<line>To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,</line>
<line>I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<line>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,</line>
<line>Malevolent to you in all aspects;</line>
<line>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</line>
<line>The crest of youth against your dignity.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<line>But I have sent for him to answer this;</line>
<line>And for this cause awhile we must neglect</line>
<line>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</line>
<line>Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we</line>
<line>Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:</line>
<line>But come yourself with speed to us again;</line>
<line>For more is to be said and to be done</line>
<line>Than out of anger can be uttered.</line>

<line>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack</line>
<line>and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon</line>
<line>benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to</line>
<line>demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.</line>
<line>What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the</line>
<line>day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes</line>
<line>capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the</line>
<line>signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself</line>
<line>a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no</line>
<line>reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand</line>
<line>the time of the day.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take</line>
<line>purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not</line>
<line>by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,</line>
<line>I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God</line>
<line>save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace</line>
<line>thou wilt have none,--</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>What, none?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to</line>
<line>prologue to an egg and butter.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not</line>
<line>us that are squires of the night's body be called</line>
<line>thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's</line>
<line>foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the</line>
<line>moon; and let men say we be men of good government,</line>
<line>being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and</line>
<line>chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the</line>
<line>fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and</line>
<line>flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,</line>
<line>by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold</line>
<line>most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most</line>
<line>dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with</line>
<line>swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'</line>
<line>now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder</line>
<line>and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my</line>
<line>hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And</line>
<line>is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and</line>
<line>thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a</line>
<line>buff jerkin?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a</line>
<line>time and oft.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;</line>
<line>and where it would not, I have used my credit.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent</line>
<line>that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet</line>
<line>wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when</line>
<line>thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is</line>
<line>with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do</line>
<line>not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>No; thou shalt.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have</line>
<line>the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my</line>
<line>humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell</line>
<line>you.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>For obtaining of suits?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman</line>
<line>hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy</line>
<line>as a gib cat or a lugged bear.</line>

<line>Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</line>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of</line>
<line>Moor-ditch?</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed</line>
<line>the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young</line>
<line>prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more</line>
<line>with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a</line>
<line>commodity of good names were to be bought. An old</line>
<line>lord of the council rated me the other day in the</line>
<line>street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet</line>
<line>he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and</line>
<line>yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<line>Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the</line>
<line>streets, and no man regards it.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue role="speech"><linegroup>
<speaker role="speaker">FALSTAFF</speaker>
<line>O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able</line>
<line>to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon</line>
<line>me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew</line>
<line>thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man</line>
<line>should speak truly, little better than one of the</line>
<line>wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give</line>
<line>it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:</line>
<line>I'll be damned for never a king's son in</line>
<line>Christendom.</line>

<line>Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down</line>

<line>These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;</line>

<line>I am not in the roll of common men.</line>
<line>Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea</line>

<line>Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?</line>

<line>By south and east is to my part assign'd:</line>
<line>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</line>
<line>And all the fertile land within that bound,</line>
<line>To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you</line>
<line>The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.</line>
<line>And our indentures tripartite are drawn;</line>
<line>Which being sealed interchangeably,</line>
<line>A business that this night may execute,</line>
<line>To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I</line>
<line>And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth</line>
<line>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</line>
<line>As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.</line>
<line>My father Glendower is not ready yet,</line>
<line>Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.</line>

<line>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.</line>
<line>I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;</line>

<line>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,</line>
<line>At thy affections, which do hold a wing</line>
<line>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</line>
<line>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.</line>
<line>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</line>
<line>And art almost an alien to the hearts</line>
<line>Of all the court and princes of my blood:</line>
<line>The hope and expectation of thy time</line>
<line>Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man</line>
<line>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</line>
<line>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</line>
<line>So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,</line>
<line>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</line>
<line>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</line>
<line>Had still kept loyal to possession</line>
<line>And left me in reputeless banishment,</line>
<line>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</line>
<line>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</line>
<line>But like a comet I was wonder'd at;</line>
<line>That men would tell their children 'This is he;'</line>
<line>Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'</line>
<line>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</line>
<line>And dress'd myself in such humility</line>
<line>That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</line>
<line>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</line>
<line>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</line>
<line>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</line>
<line>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</line>
<line>Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,</line>
<line>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</line>
<line>And won by rareness such solemnity.</line>
<line>The skipping king, he ambled up and down</line>
<line>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</line>
<line>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</line>
<line>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</line>
<line>Had his great name profaned with their scorns</line>
<line>And gave his countenance, against his name,</line>
<line>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</line>
<line>Of every beardless vain comparative,</line>
<line>Grew a companion to the common streets,</line>
<line>Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;</line>
<line>That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,</line>
<line>They surfeited with honey and began</line>
<line>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</line>
<line>More than a little is by much too much.</line>
<line>So when he had occasion to be seen,</line>
<line>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</line>
<line>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</line>
<line>As, sick and blunted with community,</line>
<line>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</line>
<line>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</line>
<line>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</line>
<line>But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,</line>
<line>Slept in his face and render'd such aspect</line>
<line>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</line>
<line>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</line>
<line>And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;</line>
<line>For thou has lost thy princely privilege</line>
<line>With vile participation: not an eye</line>
<line>But is a-weary of thy common sight,</line>

<line>The king is kind; and well we know the king</line>

<line>My father and my uncle and myself</line>

<line>And when he was not six and twenty strong,</line>
<line>Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,</line>
<line>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</line>
<line>My father gave him welcome to the shore;</line>
<line>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</line>
<line>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</line>
<line>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</line>
<line>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</line>
<line>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</line>
<line>Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.</line>
<line>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</line>
<line>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</line>
<line>The more and less came in with cap and knee;</line>
<line>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</line>
<line>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</line>
<line>Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,</line>
<line>Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him</line>
<line>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</line>
<line>He presently, as greatness knows itself,</line>
<line>Steps me a little higher than his vow</line>
<line>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</line>
<line>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;</line>
<line>And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform</line>
<line>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</line>
<line>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</line>
<line>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</line>
<line>Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,</line>
<line>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</line>
<line>The hearts of all that he did angle for;</line>
<line>Proceeded further; cut me off the heads</line>

<line>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</line>
<line>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</line>

<line>Rated mine uncle from the council-board;</line>
