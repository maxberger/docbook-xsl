<para>The alternative to <olink targetdocent="buildmake.xml">using
make</olink> is to use XSLT extension functions. Naturally this will
only be possible if you're using a processor for which the extensions
have been implemented. The Website distribution includes extensions
for Xalan and Saxon.</para>

<note>
<para>If the source pages for your website are stored in several
files, this method will probably will not work correctly all the time.
The extension can only see if the <quote>main</quote> page has
changed, not subsidiary pages that it (logically) depends on. If you
have a complex source layout, you will probably have to <olink
targetdocent="buildmake.xml">use make</olink>.</para>
