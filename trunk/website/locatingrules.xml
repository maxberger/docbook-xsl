  This is a schema-locating file for use with a RELAX NG-aware
  editor such as Emacs/nXML mode. It tells your editor to
  automatically associate any documents whose root element is
  "webpage" (that is DocBook Website documents), with the RNC
  schema file at the URI "website.rnc".

  <documentElement prefix="" localName="webpage" uri="website.rnc"/>
  <!--
  <documentElement prefix="" localName="webpage" uri="website-full.rnc"/>
    -->
</locatingRules>

<!--
  To use this file with Emacs/nXML mode, put the following into
  your .emacs file:

    (setq rng-schema-locating-files
      (append
        '("~/docbook-website/locatingrules.xml")))

  Of course, replace the pathname with the appropriate location
  for your system.
