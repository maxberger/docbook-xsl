DocBook Open Repository website source files
--------------------------------------------

These files form the sources for the DocBook Open Repository
project website at:

  http://docbook.sourceforge.net/

To build website content from these sources, follow these steps:

1. Set up a sandbox environment and check out a least a partial
   DocBook Open Repository Project CVS tree that includes:

     cvstools/
     sourceforge-webpages/
     website/

2. Change to the sourceforge-webpages directory and just type:

     make

   (You don't need to type 'make depends' first.)

   That will build the default "tabular" version of the site.

3. Optionally, you can also:
   
     * generate the alternative "non-tabular" version of the site

     * post-process all of the HTML content with 'tidy'

   The easiest way to to those things is to feed 'make' some
   variables on the command line:

     make USETIDY=1 MAKENONTAB=1

You can also use this makefile to actually install the content on
a remote webserver. In order to do that, you'll require the
following:

1. You must have scp/ssh access to the webserver to which you will
   upload your content, and you must have scp and ssh configured
   properly in your local environment.

2. You must define/specify the following variables:

     * TEMP:     local temp directory (usually '/tmp') 
     * SITEHOST: remote host to upload (scp) site content to
     * SITEDIR:  directory on remote host to upload content to
     * SITETEMP: temp directory on remote host (for untarring)

3. Type the following to start the install process:

     make dist

   That will cause a master/merged 'Changes' file to be generated
   from the Changelogs in all subdirectories. It will also cause
   the contents to be tar/gzip'ped and zipped to generate a
   tarball and zip file.

4. Type the following to do the actual upload:

     make install

5. If you want to delete all the generated content from your
   sandbox, type the following:

     make clean
