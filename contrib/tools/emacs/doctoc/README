DOCbook Table Of Contents -- doctoc
===================================

Overview
--------

The doctoc package provides a navigation aid for editing richly
structured DocBook documents with (X)Emacs. It generates a table of
contents (TOC) for the current buffer using an external perl script at
the moment. The TOC is displayed in a seperate buffer with a suiteable
major mode to jump to the respective destination.

Most of the current implementation was meant to be a prototype but
turned out to be extremely useful for me already. Speed is no issue
compared to PSGML's parsing time.

Installation
------------

Put toc.pl somewhere in your $PATH. It needs perl5 with XML::Parser
module. Installation instructions for doctoc.el can be found directly
in the file. It can be byte-compiled, but that's not neccesary,
haven't seen any noticeable delay caused by doctoc.el in comparison to
toc.pl.

Future Plans
------------

1. Removal of XEmacs specific stuff
2. Use autoloads, customize package, other Emacs conventions
3. Check if PSGMLs parse tree can/should be used
4. Support for parsed external entities, i.e. documents split into
   multiple files, with single TOC (not possible with XML::Parser)
5. Look into using speedbar
6. ID/IDREF display/selection in TOC

I do miss RefTeX's/AucTeX's elaborate features, all ideas borrowed
there.
